<h5>8A.8.1&nbsp;For Call-ups for New Equipment Photocopiers and <acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s (which may   include, within the Call-up Limitation, Additional and Reconfiguration   Items)</h5>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li><strong>Up to&nbsp;$25,000</strong> (Including the total Fixed Monthly Rate (FMR) charges, the   total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges, and <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): the Identified   User may place the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product, in the   Identified User's view, represents the best value;</li>
<li><strong>From&nbsp;$25,000.01&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$100,000.00</strong> (Including the total Fixed Monthly Rate   (FMR) charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges, and   <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): the Identified User may place the Call-up with the Active Offeror   whose Product, in the required configuration, has a Value Factor within 10% of   the best Value Factor in the required commitment period, in the given   sub-category, if the Product meets the technical and compatibility requirements   of the Identified User;</li>

<li><strong>From&nbsp;$400,000&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$5,000,000</strong> (Including the total Fixed Monthly Rate   (FMR) charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges, and   <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): only the Standing Offer Authority may place Call-ups.

</ol>
<p>The Standing Offer Authority reserves the right to negotiate the rates and   prices for Call-ups over&nbsp;$400,000&nbsp;and, where the Standing Offer Authority   determines that the available prices do not represent good value, the Standing   Offer Authority may use other methods of supply to fulfil the requirement.</p>
<p>These Call-up limitations apply to the total value of the Call-up, including   any Additional and Reconfiguration Items listed on this Standing Offer that are   included in the Call-up.</p>
<p><acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> procedures may be requested for requirements of less than&nbsp;$400,000, for   more complex requirements such as those across multiple sub-categories, or where   there are large quantities of low dollar value devices.</p>

<p>Where the Identified User's requirement is for photocopiers/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s from more than   one sub-category and where the Identified User feels that there are   administrative advantages in contracting with one supplier only for the   requirement, the Identified User is encouraged to calculate, using the tools on   the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym>/<acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym> website, the Best Value for the aggregate requirement, using their   actual print and copy volumes where possible. The Call-up limitations defined in   8.8.1&nbsp;above will apply to any such aggregate requirement.</p>
<h5>8A.8.3&nbsp;For Call-ups of Additional and Reconfiguration Items only</h5>
<p>The   Identified User may place Call-ups (valued at up to&nbsp;$25,000, <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym> included)   that consist of Additional and Reconfiguration Items only from any of the   Offerors (both Active and Inactive). Any Call-ups of Additional and   Reconfiguration Items exceeding&nbsp;$25,000&nbsp;must be issued by the Standing Offer   Authority.</p>
<h5>8A.8.4&nbsp;Terms to be Confirmed in Call-up</h5>
<p>At the time of the Call-up, the   Offeror must:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>provide the Identified User with any wiring specifications or special   environmental conditions required for the Products. Any alterations to the site   are the responsibility of the Identified User;</li>
<li>determine the language   requirements of the Identified User for the user manuals to be delivered with   the Products; and</li>
<li>determine whether receipt of the user manuals on <acronym title="Compact Disc Read-only Memory">CD-ROM</acronym> or   downloadable from the Internet is acceptable (instead of delivery of hard   copies)</li>
</ol>
<h5>8A.8.5&nbsp;Requirements greather than&nbsp;$25,000&nbsp;(Including the total Fixed Monthly   Rate (FMR) cost, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges, and   <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>) that cannot be satisfied by the Active Offeror(s) meeting the   conditions of 8.8.1&nbsp;above for the required configuration in the required   sub-category</h5> 
<p>Where the Standing Offer Authority agrees that the Active   Offeror(s) meeting the conditions of 8.8.1&nbsp;above cannot satisfy an Identified   User's requirement in a Sub-category because that Offeror:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User within the   Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract clauses;</li>
  <li>does not   have a product listed in the Best Value Grid on the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym> website that meets all   the legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including   equipment security needs;</li>
  <li>has failed the compatibility sub-test for that   requirement; or</li>
  <li>has already defaulted on a Call-up issued by the Identified   User for the required Products; or,</li>
  <li>has shown itself incapable of meeting the   service requirements for that specific Identified User,</li>
	</ol>
<p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up (or the Identified User   requests and receives written permission from the Standing Offer Authority to   place a Call-up) with the next highest Active Offeror that can fulfil the needs   of the Identified User.</p>
<h5>8A.8.6&nbsp;Requirements that Cannot be Satisfied by Active Offerors</h5>
<p>Where the   Standing Offer Authority determines that the none of Active Offerors can satisfy   an Identified User's requirement in any Sub-category because the Active   Offerors:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User within the   Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract clauses;</li>
  <li>do not have   a product listed in the Best Value Grid on the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym> website that meets all the   legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including equipment   security needs;</li>
  <li>have all failed the compatibility sub-test for that   requirement;</li>
  <li>have defaulted on Call-ups for the Products currently required   by the Identified User; or,</li>
  <li>have shown themselves incapable of meeting the   service requirements for that specific Identified User,</li>
	</ol>
<p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up with one of the other   Offerors in the relevant Sub-category that can satisfy these requirements, at   the unit price(s) that Offeror offered during the most recent downward price   revision or the Standing Offer Authority may use other sourcing methods to   procure the Products. Only the Standing Offer Authority can place Call-ups with   Offerors other than the Active Offerors. The Offeror agrees not to accept any   Call-ups, except from the Standing Offer Authority, while it is not an Active   Offeror.</p>
<h5>8A.8.7&nbsp;Authority of Identified Users to Place Direct Call-ups may be   Withdrawn</h5>
<p>The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, provide the Offerors   with 30&nbsp;days' written notice that the authority of an Identified User to place   direct Call-ups has been withdrawn. In this case, only the Standing Offer   Authority may make Call-ups on behalf of that Identified User and the Offeror   agrees not to fulfil any Call-ups made directly by that Identified User.</p>
<h5>8A.8.8&nbsp;Renewal Equipment</h5>
<p>Individual Call-ups made by Identified Users for   Renewal Equipment pursuant to the Standing Offer must not exceed <strong>$200,000.00</strong>   (including the total Fixed Monthly Rate (FMR) cost, the total estimated Cost Per   Copy/print (CPC) charges, and <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>).</p>
<h5>8A.8.9&nbsp;Compatibility Sub-Test</h5>
<p>For any Call-up of five (5) photocopiers/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s   or more, an Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority may specify in the   Call-up that the Offeror provide a photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> in the configuration(s)   required for a compatibility sub-test, prior to delivery of the products, to   determine whether the ordered Product(s) will meet the Identified User's   compatibility requirements. To complete these tests, the Offeror must deliver   and set up (at any location designated by Canada, as long as it is within a   radius of 100&nbsp;<acronym title="kilometre">km</acronym> of any city or town with a population of at least 30,000,   except <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</acronym> areas, within 3&nbsp;working days, up to two (2) of the product(s) for   testing.</p>
<p>The products delivered for testing must:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>be configured in accordance with the Identified Users actual requirements;</li>
  <li>be loaded with all necessary drivers; and</li>
  <li>be compatible with the   specific hardware, network or software requirements identified by the Identified   User or the Standing Offer Authority at the time notice of testing is given to   the Offeror.</li>
	</ol>
<p>If the testing indicates that some upgrades/changes (for example, to the   drivers or firmware) are required, Canada will work with the Offeror to resolve   these issues, provided they are reasonable within a reasonable period. If   testing demonstrates that a Product is not compatible with the Identified User's   particular environment, the Call-up may be cancelled in its entirety and the   next highest Active Offeror will be considered, for the purposes of the Call-up   Limitations, to have the Product with the best Value Factor.</p>
<p>If the test unit provided is new and is to be delivered to the end-user's   location, and if it is agreed upon with the Identified User, the test unit may   be considered as the first unit of the subsequent delivery. Once compatibility   is assured, arrangements will be made for delivery of the rest of the order.</p>

<h3 id="o12a">12A. Administrative Issues</h3>
<h4>12A.1&nbsp;Promotional/Marketing Literature</h4>
<p>The Offeror agrees and understands   that any promotional/marketing literature produced as a result of having a   Standing Offer and for use by the Identified Users must be approved by its <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>   Standing Offer Authority prior to distribution. This includes any materials   citing the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> number that are sent to <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> Authorized Agents for distribution   to clients.</p>
<h4>12A.2&nbsp;Withdrawal by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> of Authority to Call-up Against the Standing Offer</h4>
<p>If during the course of the Standing Offer the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer   Authority becomes aware that the Offeror is in violation of the terms and   conditions of any resulting Standing Offer (<acronym title="exempli gratia">e.g.</acronym>, either through random   inspections or written complaint from any Identified user), Canada may set aside   use of the Standing Offer, as detailed below, for a specified period or for the   remainder of the Standing Offer Period.</p>
<h5>12A.2.1&nbsp;Causes</h5>
<p>Conditions which may result in the suspension of any   resulting Standing Offer include:</p>
<ol class="decimal double-space">
<li>Shipment of equipment which is not on the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>, or unauthorized equipment   substitutions;</li>
<li>Shipment of equipment with an unauthorized change in internal   components;</li>
<li>Documented history of chronic late deliveries. The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer   Authority may meet or correspond with the Offeror's management after reported   instances of late delivery. If, after meeting or corresponding with the   Offeror's management, the delivery situation is not sufficiently improved, the   Standing Offer may be set aside;</li>
<li>Documented history of chronic poor maintenance service. The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>   Standing Offer Authority will meet or correspond with the Offeror's management   after reported instances of poor maintenance service. If, after meeting or   corresponding with the Offeror's management, the maintenance situation is not   sufficiently improved, the Standing Offer will be set aside;</li>
<li>Violation of any of the specific terms and conditions detailed in the Standing   Offer.</li>
<li>Violation of any of the specific terms and conditions detailed in any   resulting Call-up.</li>
</ol>
<h5>12A.2.2&nbsp;Remedies</h5>
<p>The first violation of any of the terms and conditions of   the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>, as detailed herein, may result in setting aside the use of the   Offeror's Standing Offer for a period of three (3) months. Any subsequent   violation may result in setting aside the use of the Offeror's Offer for the   remainder of the Standing Offer period.</p>
<p>Each reported instance of violation will be investigated by the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>   Standing Offer Authority to confirm that the Offeror is indeed in violation of   the terms and conditions of any resulting Standing Offer. A Standing Offer   Committee consisting of the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Contractual Authority and two senior   contracting authorities will then determine the appropriate course of action.   The Offeror will then be informed of the findings and course of action   determined by the Standing Offer Committee.</p>
<h5>12A.2.3&nbsp;Recourse</h5>
<p>If the Offeror does not agree with the ruling of the   Standing Offer Committee, the Offeror may appeal the decision in writing in the   following sequence:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer Authority;</li>
  <li>Manager, Acquisitions, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Pacific   Region;</li>

  <li>Regional   Director General, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Pacific Region.</li>
	</ol>
<h4>12A.3&nbsp;Subsequent Acquisition of a Company or all or part of its Business   Covered by a Standing Offer</h4>
<p>It sometimes occurs after a Standing Offer has   been accepted that the company or all or part of its business that is covered by   a Standing Offer is acquired by another entity and a question arises as to how   Canada can make call-ups against the original Standing Offer. Canada reserves   the right in those circumstances to consent to an assignment of all or part of   the Standing Offer rights to the new entity or to simply order directly from the   new entity.</p>
<h4>12A.4&nbsp;Creation of New Categories</h4>
<p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> may, at any time, conduct further   Requests for Standing Offers for new categories or sub-categories and the   resulting offers may be incorporated into this Standing Offer. These   requirements will be subject to an open competition posted on the Government   Electronic Tendering Service.</p>
<h4>12A.5&nbsp;Expansion of Offerors following Withdrawal of Authority to Use Standing   Offer</h4>
<p>If the number of Offerors for any given Category or Sub-Category is   reduced during the Standing Offer Period for any reason (including setting aside   authority to use a Standing Offer or voluntary withdrawal by the Offeror),   Canada may, in its sole discretion, do one or more of the following in respect   of any Category or Sub-Category:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
  <li>leave the Category or Sub-Category &quot;as is&quot; (<acronym title="id est">i.e.</acronym>, the Standing Offers of the   remaining Offerors will remain available for Call-ups and no new Offerors will   be added);</li>
  <li>call for new Offers in respect of one or more affected Category or   Sub-Category through the Government Electronic Tendering Service; or</li>
  <li>contact the Offeror (if any) whose offered Product complied with all the   requirements of the Request for Standing Offer that resulted in the issuance of   this Standing Offer and was &quot;next in line&quot; under the evaluation methodology, but   who was not issued a Standing Offer, and
	<ol class="lower-roman">
  <li>in the case of Category A, the new Offeror agrees to meet or better the   aggregate Value Factor of the existing Products of the Offeror whose Standing   Offer has been cancelled; or</li>
  <li>in the case of all other Sub-Categories, the new Offeror agrees to meet or   better the Value Factor in the relevant Sub-Category(ies) of the existing   Product(s) of the Offeror whose Standing Offer has been cancelled;<br /><br />
	then that new Offeror may be issued a Standing Offer in the applicable Category or   Sub-Category. If the new Offeror does not agree to meet or better the Value   Factor of the previous Offeror's Product, no Standing Offer will be issued to   that Offeror and Canada may, but will have no obligation to, contact the   next-ranked Offeror.</li>

<h4>16A.1&nbsp;Offeror's Responsibility</h4>
<ol class="decimal double-space">
<li>It will be the sole responsibility of the   Offeror to decide whether or not any other insurance coverage, in addition to   the insurance requirements stipulated in the bid solicitation and resulting   Standing Offer, is necessary for its own protection or to fulfil its obligations   under the Standing Offer. Any such additional insurance must be provided and   maintained by the Offeror at its own expense.<br /><br />
The following insurance provisions will not limit any insurance required by   federal, provincial or municipal law.</li>

<li>If such a claim is made or appears likely to be made, Canada agrees to   permit the Offeror to enable Canada at the Offeror's expense, to continue to use   the equipment or software or to modify or replace it with equipment or software   which has published specifications equal or superior to the equipment or   software being replaced. If the Offeror determines that none of these   alternatives is reasonably available, Canada may elect, at the Offeror's   expense, to independently secure the right to continue to use the equipment or   software, or Canada may require the Offeror to accept the return of the   equipment or software and to refund all monies paid to the Offeror under the   Standing Offer for the equipment and software, as well as all amounts paid for   services and license and development fees.</li>
<li>The provisions of Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in situations   where the Offeror was instructed by Canada to purchase a specific item of   equipment or software from a specific source on behalf of Canada. In this case,   the Offeror must ensure that its subcontract for the equipment or software   states that &quot;If a third party claims that equipment or software that the   subcontractor supplies under the Standing Offer infringes any intellectual   right, the subcontractor, if requested to do so by either the Offeror or Canada,   will defend the Offeror and Canada against that claim at the subcontractor's   expense and will pay all costs, damages and legal fees that a court finally   awards.&quot; In the event that the Offeror is unable to incorporate this into its   subcontract, then it will advise Canada of the situation and not proceed with   the subcontract without receiving written notice from Canada that the level of   intellectual property right infringement protection is acceptable.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to Canada's right to terminate the Standing Offer for   default prior to completion of the work, the above represents the Offeror's   entire obligation to Canada regarding any claim of infringement.</li>
<li>The Offeror has no obligation regarding any claim based on any of the   following:
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>Canada's unauthorized modification of the equipment or software, or   Canada's unauthorized use of the equipment or software in other than its   specified operating environment;</li>
<li>the combination, operation or use of the equipment or software with any   product, data or apparatus that the Offeror did not provide under the Standing   Offer, or which combination, operation or use the Offeror did not authorize or   approve in advance, if infringement would not have occurred but for such   combination, operation or use.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>2B.3.2&nbsp;Limitation of Liability</h5>
<ol class="decimal double-space">

With respect to third party claims where the third party does   not have a cause of action directly against the Party causing the damage, this   Section does not prevent or restrict in any way Canada's right to pursue and   enforce any rights that it may have against the Contractor. In the event of any   conflict between this Section (1) and any other Section of this Article, this   Section (1) will prevail.</li>

<li>all damages for breach of confidentiality;</li>
<li>all damages arising from claims for liens, attachments, charges or other   encumbrances or claims upon or in respect of any materials, parts,   work-in-process or finished work furnished to, or in respect of which any   payment has been made by, Canada, provided that this Subsection does not apply   to claims of intellectual property infringement which claims are covered in   Subsection (a) above; and,</li>
<li>any other direct damages caused by the Contractor, its employees, agents   or subcontractors in relation to this Contract, including re-procurement costs   as defined below, and restoration of records to the extent that the Contractor   fails to comply with Section 4&nbsp;below, up to an aggregate maximum for this   Subsection 2&nbsp;(f) of <strong>$1,000,000</strong>.</li>
</ol></li>
  <li>The Contractor will not be liable to   Canada for the following:

<li>damages of third parties claimed against Canada except those referred to   in Subsections 2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above;</li>
<li>harm to Canada's records or data, except for the restoration set out in   Section 4&nbsp;below, and subject to the limitation set out in Subsection 2(f) above;   or</li>
<li>special, indirect or consequential damages (other than the payments   referred to in Subsection 2(a) above, and the damages referred to in Subsection   2(b) above), even if the Contractor is made aware of the potential for such   damages, including lost profits and lost savings.</li>
</ol>
Canada is responsible for maintaining adequate backup of its records and data   to enable their restoration if needed for any reason. If Canada's records or   data are harmed by the Contractor's or a subcontractor's negligence or willful   act, the Contractor is responsible for restoring Canada's records and data to   the same state as in the last available backup copy. For the purposes of this   Article:
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>total estimated cost will mean the dollar amount shown on the first page   of the Contract in the cell titled &quot;Total Estimated Cost&quot;;</li>
<li>re-procurement costs will mean all identifiable direct costs incurred by   Canada to re-procure the Work with another contractor, including de-installation   and return of the Work to the Contractor, administrative costs of selecting   another contractor or re-tendering all or part of the Contract, as applicable,   and any increase in the price payable by Canada for the other Work having   equivalent functionality, performance and quality; and,</li>
<li>the term &quot;Contract&quot; will apply to stand-alone contracts, and to each   call-up, purchase order and other contractual document, irrespective of its   title, issued under a Standing Offer or a Supply Arrangement.</li>

<h4>5B.1&nbsp;Expiration Notice</h4>
<p>The Offeror must notify the Identified User a   minimum of ninety (90) days before the expiration date of any contract. This   reminder will allow for a timely reassessment of the end user's printing and   copying requirements.</p>

<p>Where the original Commitment Period   was 2, 3, or 4&nbsp;years, Canada may, at its option, through contract amendment,   change the Commitment Period to a Commitment Period of longer duration at any   time during the Standing Offer period, and the total <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> and <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rate associated   with the revised Commitment Period will be applicable to all months of the new   Commitment Period, including those months that the equipment has already been   installed with any overpayment to date to be credited against future costs; but   in no event will the recalculated amount to the date of the change exceed the   amount already paid. The Installation Date of the new Commitment Period must be   the same as the installation date of the original.</p>
<h4>5B.3&nbsp;Ninety (90) Day Extension at end of Period and Extension after Standing   Offer Expires</h4>
<p>Where the original Commitment Period was 2, 3, 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;years,   Canada may at its option, through Contract Amendment, (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> 942) extend a   Commitment Period for a period of up to ninety (90) days at the same or a lower   Total <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> and <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rate than that associated with the Commitment Period prior to   such extension.</p>
<p>In the event that an Offeror is not, for any reason whatsoever, granted a   Standing Offer for the period subsequent to the period of the Standing Offer and   in order to avoid administrative chaos and inconvenience Canada may at its   option, through Amendment to the Call-up, extend a Commitment Period for a   period of up to one (1) year at the same or a lower Total <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> and <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rate than   that associated with the Commitment Period prior to such extension.</p>
<h4>5B.4&nbsp;Termination</h4>
<p>Canada may at its option, with two weeks notice, terminate   the use of any installed photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>, where such termination would take   effect at the end of the month following the two week notice period subject to   the following conditions:</p>
<h5>5B.4.1&nbsp;Termination Fees</h5>
<p>Where the termination takes place prior to the   completion of the applicable Commitment Period, then Canada will pay a fixed   Termination Fee. The Contractor may choose to, but is not obliged to, waive or   reduce this Termination Fee in the event of a subsequent Call-up for new   equipment. In no case will the Termination Fee be added to the new Call-up.</p>
<p>The Termination Fee will be equal to the difference between the actual amount   paid to-date and an Adjusted Amount. The Adjusted Amount will be calculated as   following:</p>
<ol class="decimal double-space">
<li>where the <strong>original Commitment Period was 2, 3, 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;years and the   actual period of installation was less than 24&nbsp;months</strong>, then the Adjusted Amount   will be based on the rates associated with a <strong>TWO (2) Year Commitment Period</strong>   multiplied by 24&nbsp;months; but in no event will the Termination Fee exceed the   balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate that would have been due had the lease not   been terminated;</li>
<li>where the <strong>original Commitment Period was 3, 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;years and where the   actual period of installation was less than 36&nbsp;months</strong>, then the Adjusted Amount   will be based on the rates associated with a <strong>TWO (2) Year</strong> Commitment Period   multiplied by the actual number of months that the equipment was installed; but   in no event will the Termination Fee exceed the amount that would have been due   <strong>for 36&nbsp;months</strong> using the Fixed Monthly Rate for a <strong>THREE (3) Year</strong> Commitment   Period, or exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate that would have been due   had the lease not been terminated.</li>
<li>where the <strong>original Commitment Period was 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;years and where the   actual period of installation was less than 48&nbsp;months</strong>, then the Adjusted Amount   will be based on the rates associated with a <strong>THREE (3) Year</strong> Commitment Period   multiplied by the actual number of months that the equipment was installed; but   in no event will the Termination Fee exceed the amount that would have been due   for 48&nbsp;months using the Fixed Monthly Rate for a <strong>FOUR (4) YEAR</strong> Commitment Period   or exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate that would have been due had the   lease not been terminated.</li>
<li>where the <strong>original Commitment Period was 5&nbsp;years and where the actual   period of installation was less than 60&nbsp;months</strong>, then the Adjusted Amount will be   based on the rates associated with a <strong>FOUR (4) Year</strong> Commitment Period multiplied   by the actual number of months that the equipment was installed; but in no event   will the Termination Fee exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate that would   have been due had the Commitment Period not been terminated.</li>
</ol>
<h5>5B.4.2&nbsp;Removal of Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment</h5>
  <p>Should the   Identified User wish to remove Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment prior to   the completion of the applicable Commitment Period for that equipment, this is   not considered a termination of the base unit. However, the Offeror may charge a   termination fee for the option(s) removed that will be determined in the same   way as for the base machinery but with the Adjusted Amount to be determined from   the <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> of the optional equipment only. There will be no additional Professional   Services charges for the removal of equipment.</p>
<h5>5B.4.3&nbsp;Termination of a Photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> during Renewal Periods</h5>
  <p>Where an   installed photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> is in a renewal period and where the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>   has been installed for more than five (5) years, and where the Identified User   can show documented evidence of excessive downtime or reduction of   functionality, the Renewal Contract may be terminated with a minimum of thirty   days notice and no Termination Fees will apply.</p>

<h3 id="annexe-annex-a5">A5. Deconfiguration and Reconfiguration</h3>
<h4>A 5.1&nbsp;Deconfiguration of Equipment</h4>
<p>Where the Identified User will be   allowed to deconfigure from the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> Configuration to call up an   unconnected photocopier only device or equipment with different options, the   configuration has been broken out to indicate the part numbers and rates for   each modular piece included in with the sum of the parts equaling the total Base   <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> for the model quoted. These broken out rates must be identical to the rates   quoted in the Additional/Reconfiguration Equipment &ndash; Purchase or Lease section   of Annex D, where they must be available for reconfiguration.</p>
<p>The Offeror is not required to quote Breakout pricing but must not supply   less than the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> Configuration for any Call-up against any   resulting Standing Offer unless the rates are broken out in their offer.</p>
<h5>A 5.1.1&nbsp;Hard Drives</h5>
  <p>Where the hard drive of a photocopier is removable   and to enable Identified Users with security concerns to request the removal of   the hard drive at the end of their lease, Offerors must break out the hard drive   in the Deconfigured Pricing and have it available as a Purchase Priced option in   the Additional/Reconfiguration Equipment listings. The purchase price must   include all services costs to remove the hard drive at the end of the lease, if   applicable.</p>
<p>While it is not required that the Hard Drive be removable or that the Offeror   quote a price for removal and purchase, Identified Users may use this factor to   determine whether or not the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> meets their functional security   requirements in determination of their Best Value.</p>
<h4>A 5.2&nbsp;Reconfiguration of Equipment</h4>
  <p>Modular equipment added to form the   <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> Configuration as per the specifications of the sub-category and broken out   in the Breakout for Unconnected or Deconfigured Lease rates of the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>   Configuration must also be quoted the Additional Equipment &ndash; Purchase or Lease   section of Annex D to allow the Identified User to reconfigure the installed   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> at a later date. The Fixed Monthly Rates for Reconfiguration   Equipment must be the same as the <acronym title="Fixed Monthly Rate">FMR</acronym> broken out in the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> Configuration.   However, Professional Services charges may apply for the field reconfiguration   of any equipment as per Article A 5.6, following. A purchase price may also be   quoted for Reconfiguration Equipment. </p>
<h4>A 5.3&nbsp;Additional Equipment &ndash; Purchase or Lease</h4>
  <p>The Offeror may offer   additional equipment other than that required by the specifications, which   attaches directly to or is used by the new photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> offered. The Offeror   must offer this equipment at the Fixed Monthly Rates quoted in Annex C. Purchase   pricing may also be offered but is not required. Where the Offeror can present   adequate justification (third party software licensing, <acronym title="et cetera">etc.</acronym>), Additional   Equipment may be quoted with purchase prices only. When purchase prices only are   quoted, the Offeror may not supply this equipment or software on a lease basis   as part of any Call-up.</p>
<p>Pricing quoted for these options does not form part of the Evaluated Cost in   the evaluation, although Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on   any optional equipment and to reject any equipment that do not meet the criteria   of Good Value to Canada or for which there is not an acceptable reason for   quoting purchase prices only.</p>
<p>Offerors are not permitted to offer additional print controllers for the   reconfiguration of <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> equipment.</p>
<p>The Offeror may apply to add Additional Equipment at any time during the   Standing Offer period for inclusion during the following Refresh Date, but   agrees that no Additional Equipment will be shipped until formally authorized by   the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer Authority in writing.</p>
<h4>A 5.4&nbsp;Call-up of Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment</h4>
  <p>Reconfiguration   and Additional Equipment may be called up from the Standing Offer at any time   for installation on the installed new or renewal photocopier(s)/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>(s). This   equipment may be purchased outright if the Offeror has quoted a purchase price   in Annex D or DR of their Standing Offer or the equipment may be leased at the   rates quoted in Annex D or DR. </p>
<p>Deconfiguration/Reconfiguration Equipment quoted (or equal) must be available   for Call-up during the full Period of the Standing Offer.</p>
<p>All Additional Equipment that is purchased must include a minimum one year   on-site warranty and will be installed by the Offeror and removed by the Offeror   at the end of the Commitment Period of the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> onto which it is   installed. It will remain the property of the Identified User.</p>
<p>The Commitment Period for the lease of Additional or Reconfiguration   Equipment must not extend past the Commitment Period of the new or renewal   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> to which it will be attached and this Commitment Period may be   extended in the same ways as that of the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> (Part 6&nbsp;B 5.2).   Termination Fees may be applicable if Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment is   removed before the end of the Commitment Period as per Part 6&nbsp;B 5.4.</p>
<h4>A 5.5&nbsp;Call-up of Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment in Nonstandard   Commitment Periods</h4>
  <p>For periods other than the stated Commitment Periods, the   Offeror may negotiate with the Identified User to determine the most   advantageous rate to Canada. At no time will the rate for the Reconfiguration or   Upgrade Equipment exceed the rate of the nearest full Commitment Period for the   equipment.</p>
<h4>A 5.6&nbsp;Professional Services for Field Installed Additional and   Reconfiguration Equipment</h4>
<p>When Reconfiguration Equipment is subsequently   added back to the installed configuration or when Additional Equipment is   installed subsequent to the initial Call-up (&quot;field installation&quot;), or when   Reconfiguration Equipment is added to a Renewal photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>, the Offeror   will have the right to add an additional charge equaling up to one (1) hour of   Installation and/or Configuration, one (1) hour of Systems Integration and two   (2) hours of User Training to the Call-up at the rates quoted in the   Professional Services section of Annex D.</p>
<p>Any additional Professional Services must be listed on the Call-up document   for the Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment. Additional Professional   Services must not be provided without the written permission of the Identified   User.</p>
<p>Rates quoted for these professional services do not form part of the   Evaluated Cost in the evaluation, although Canada reserves the right to perform   a pricing audit on any professional services rates and to reject any   professional services rates that do not meet the criteria of Good Value to   Canada.</p>

<h2 id="annexe-annex-j">Annex J &ndash; <acronym title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</acronym> Benchmark Testing</h2>
<h3>J 1.0&nbsp;Overview</h3>
<p>The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail   evaluation. It is used to generate a score based on the performance (speed),   quality of output, features and usability of the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>. This score is   used in the determination of Value for Dollar in the Financial Evaluation. The   data generated through the benchmark testing will be posted on the Imaging   Product Management Group Internet site to assist Identified Users in their   purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>While generally only technically compliant equipment of technically compliant   Offerors is tested, Offerors with outstanding compliance issues may request   to have their photocopier(s)/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>(s) tested. Should the issues not be resolved by   the end of the testing period, the equipment will be eliminated and any   Benchmark fees paid will be forfeited.</p>
<h3>J 2.0&nbsp;Benchmark General Provisions</h3>

A reasonable list of options to be offered as part of the resulting Standing   Offer will be negotiated with the successful Offeror. The acceptance of all or   any options will be at the discretion of the Standing Offer Authority on the   basis of value to Canada. Only Additional Equipment that has been accepted for   the Standing Offer may be acquired through the Call-up process so Offerors   should ensure that all applicable equipment has been proposed and listed.<br /><br />
The Offeror must quote Fixed Monthly Rates for Reconfiguration Equipment and   Additional Equipment available for each product for each Commitment Period of   12, 24, 36, 48&nbsp;and 60&nbsp;months where such rates will be firm ceiling rates during   the applicable Commitment Period for applicable equipment.<br /><br />
In addition to the Fixed Monthly Rates, the Offeror may also quote a firm   ceiling purchase price for Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment.

If an acceptable rate cannot be negotiated between the Offeror and Canada,   renewal pricing will not be listed for the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rates</strong><br /><br />
The <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates for first renewals must be submitted as a percentage of the   original <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates that the Identified User is paying, not exceeding 125% of the   original <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates.<br /><br />
The <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates for second renewals must be submitted as a percentage of the   first renewal <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates that the Identified User is paying, not exceeding 125%   of the first renewal <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rates.<br /><br />
The <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rate is defined as the cost per printed or copied page and is fixed   for the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> Base Configuration for a connected photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> for each of the   three Renewal Commitment Periods (12, 24&nbsp;and 36&nbsp;months) where such rates will be   firm ceiling rates during the applicable Commitment Period for the applicable   equipment.

For monochrome categories only, the cost of all imaging consumables (toner   and developer, if applicable) must be included as part of the <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rates.<br /><br />
For colour categories, wherever the original <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> rates for the   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> were quoted toner-out, the cost of toners must not be included   as part of the <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rates, although the cost of all other imaging consumables   must be incorporated into these rates.<br /><br />
Where the cost of colour toners was not included as part of the <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rate of   an existing photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>, the cost of colour toners must be submitted as a   percentage of the colour toner price from the last <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> on which the   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> existed, not exceeding 125% of this price. Where the cost of   colour toners was included as part of the <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> rate of an existing   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>, the Offeror must submit &quot;N/A&quot; for the colour toner pricing.<br /><br />

These prices will be firm ceiling prices during the applicable Renewal   Commitment Period for the applicable equipment and downward revisions only will   be accepted. Price reductions may be submitted to the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer   Authority for publication on the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym> site.<br /><br />

  <p>Once the Offeror has been   accepted as compliant, the compliance of each of the Offeror's proposed products   will be examined and their compliance to the mandatory requirements and   specifications will be verified or confirmed.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Team will:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>verify the Statements of Compliance to the Equipment Specifications in   Annex A found on the Annex C submissions. Products found subsequently to NOT   comply to the required specifications will be eliminated at that time and any   Benchmark fees paid are forfeited;</li>
<li>verify the proofs submitted for
<ol class="decimal">
  <li>Electrical certification (<acronym title="Canadian Standards Association">CSA</acronym> ,<acronym title="Underwriters Laboratories of Canada">cUL</acronym>   or other);</li>
  <li>Industry Canada <acronym title="Interference-Causing Equipment Standard">ICES</acronym> certifications; and,</li>

<li>verify the information provided in support of Annex K 5.3&nbsp;&ndash; Environmental   Considerations</li>
<li>verify the bilingual documentation (brochures and data sheets) provided in   Annex K 5.2.5.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technical and user manuals will be examined at the Benchmark site. If, at   that time, the user manuals are not compliant to the requirements of Annex K   5.2.5., the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> associated with them may be eliminated from   consideration and any Benchmark fees paid are forfeited.</p>
<h3>M 4.0&nbsp;Product Benchmark Testing</h3>
<h4>M 4.1&nbsp;<acronym title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</acronym> Benchmark Testing</h4>
  <p>During the bid evaluation phase and upon   Canada's request, Offerors will allow Canada to conduct an evaluation, which may   include but not be limited to, offeror's legal status, facilities, technical,   financial and managerial capabilities to fulfill the requirements stated in this   bid solicitation.</p>
<p>Once it is determined that Offerors meet the mandatory requirements of the   <acronym title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</acronym> and that the photocopiers/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s offered by these Offerors meet the minimum   technical specifications, a list of these products will be submitted to <acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym>   Canada Corp. (<acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym>). <acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym>, in cooperation with the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Standing Offer   Authority, will then draw up the Benchmark Test Schedule and <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> will notify   the Offerors when to bring in their products. Additional detail about the test   procedure and the address of the bench test site will be supplied at this   time.</p>
<p>The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation but is used   rather to generate a score based on the performance (speed), quality of output,   features and usability of the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>. This score is used in the   determination of Value for Dollar in the Financial Evaluation. The data   generated through the benchmark testing will be posted on the Digital Connected   photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> Internet site to assist Identified Users in their purchasing   decisions.</p>
<p>Offerors with outstanding compliance issues may request to have their   product(s) tested but should the issues not be resolved by the end of the   testing period, the product(s) will be eliminated and any Benchmark fees paid   are forfeited.</p>
<h4>M 4.2&nbsp;<acronym title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</acronym> Benchmark Test Procedures</h4>
  <p>Benchmark Tests as detailed in Annex   J &ndash; <acronym title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</acronym> Benchmark Testing, will be conducted prior to the Financial Evaluation,   the sole exception being as detailed in Annex M 2.4.3.</p>
<h3>M 5.0&nbsp;Financial Evaluation &ndash; New Equipment</h3>
<p>Following Benchmark Testing,   the Offeror's Financial Offer will be evaluated and an Evaluated Cost will be   calculated for each product successfully tested. This will be calculated from   the Fixed Monthly Rates and the <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rates proposed in Annex C, less any   reductions for Environmental Programs in place and Security of the device.</p>
<p>ONLY TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT BIDS FOR PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE COMPLETED BENCHMARK   TESTING WILL BE USED IN THE FINANCIAL EVALUATION</p>
<h4>M 5.1&nbsp;Detailed Cost Evaluation &ndash; New Equipment</h4>
  <p>The average estimated cost   for each new monochrome photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>, as detailed in the appropriate Annex D   is based on the sum of the amounts calculated in Annex M 5.1.1&nbsp;(Total Monthly   Rate Cost) and Annex M 5.1.2&nbsp;(Total <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rate Cost) to produce the Base Evaluated   Cost.</p>
<p>For colour photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> sub-categories only, the Base Evaluated Cost is   calculated in Annex M 5.1.3&nbsp;using two <acronym title="cost per copy/print">CPC</acronym> Rates.</p>
<p>The Base Evaluated Cost for both monochrome and colour photocopiers/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s is   then decreased by the reduction for Environmental Programs in place and for the   Security Level of the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> (up to a total of 5% as per Annex K 5.3.2&nbsp;and K 5.4), if applicable, to create the Total Evaluated Cost.</p>

<h4>M 5.2&nbsp;Product Selection &ndash; New Equipment</h4>
<p>Once the Total Evaluated Cost for each photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> submitted as New   Equipment is calculated and the Total Weighted Points for each photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>   have been received from the testing authority, a dollar of costs per benchmark   point Value Factor is calculated by dividing the Total Evaluated Cost by the   Total Overall Score achieved in the benchmark tests.</p>
<h5>M 5.2.1&nbsp;Category A &ndash; Aggregated</h5>
<p>Products from the same Offeror in the sub-categories of Category A will be   selected on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p>The Value Factor of each product of Category A will be weighted as   follows:</p>
<ul class="noBullet">
  <li>Sub-category A1: 35%</li>
  <li>Sub-category A2: 20%</li>
  <li>Sub-category A3:   45%</li>
</ul>
<p>The weighted Value Factors will be added together to arrive at the Aggregate   Value Factor for 
  Category A.</p>
<p>Standing Offers will be put in place for Offerors having photocopiers/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym>s   with an Aggregate Value Factor of no more than 50% higher than the Offeror with   the lowest Value Factor in Category A. An Offeror will either receive a Standing   Offer for all sub-categories of Category A, or none at all. Standing Offers will   not be put in place for less than all three sub-categories of Category A.</p>
<h5>M 5.2.2&nbsp;Categories B through E &ndash; Sub-categories Evaluated Separately</h5>
<p>For Categories B through E, the sub-categories will be evaluated separately.   Standing Offers will be put in place for Offerors having a photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> with   a Value Factor of no more than 50% higher than the photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> with the   lowest Value Factor that sub-category.</p>
<p>The photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> in each sub-category offering the lowest dollars of cost   per benchmark point Value Factor will be highlighted as offering the Best Value   to Canada in the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> configuration.</p>
<p>For sub-categories with only one product offered, selection will be made by   the Evaluation Committee on the basis of price support proving Good Value to   Canada.</p>
<p>Only the lowest priced identical photocopier/<acronym title="Multifunction Device">MFD</acronym> models offered will be   evaluated and accepted.</p>
<h5>M 5.2.3&nbsp;Active and Inactive Products</h5>
<p>During evaluation of the initial Offers prior to <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> issuance and during   each subsequent Product and Pricing Refresh, a product that achieves a Value   Factor of no more than 20% higher than the product with the lowest Value Factor   in any given sub-category will be listed as an Active Product on the Offeror's   <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>. If at any point in time during the period of the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> a product's Value   Factor falls outside of this 20% range, the product will then be listed as an   Inactive Product.</p>
<p>For Category A, the Aggregate Value Factor will be used.</p>
<h5>M 5.2.4&nbsp;Product and Pricing Refresh</h5>
<p>A refresh of the products and pricing on the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> will be performed by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>   approximately every two months after <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> issuance. A schedule of the Refresh   Dates will form part of the Standing Offer Agreement.</p>
