              refusing to take back product or not recycling that product in
              accordance with the minimum requirements of the standing offer,
              Canada will arrange to have the subject material recovered and
              disposed off appropriately at the cost of the Offeror. In addition,
              the Offeror will have their standing offer de authorized and will
              be excluded from holding a similar standing offer with Canada for
              a minimum of one year from the date of determination.</p>
            <p>d) Packaging Recycling<br>

  The Offeror's product must be Energy Star qualified at the time of product
    acceptance. The vendor must Ship all products with the Energy Star low-power
    feature activated or enabled. This eliminates the need for users to configure
    the power-management feature after delivery and helps to ensure that they
    use the energy-saving feature.</p>
            <p>A 4.7.2 The following Environmental Program is an optional requirement
              for which the Offeror will receive an Evaluation Reduction of 3%

              Certification at time of initial offer but achieves certification
              subsequent to Standing Offer issue, the Offeror may submit a request
              and proof of certification for the additional reduction at any
              pricing refresh period.</p>
