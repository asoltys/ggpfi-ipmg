              with Identified Users of any resulting Standing Offer. These agents

              company name. Service must be available, at a minimum, in the Official

              During the Standing Offer Period, PWGSC may begin using an electronic
                purchasing tool for one or more Authorized Users. It may be required
                that the Offeror provide the list of authorized lease/sales agents
                and service providers in a format conforming with the requirements
                of this electronic purchasing tool.</p>

                and Northern Development (DIAND) definition of Aboriginal business,
                so that the Identified User may have the option of setting aside
                the requirement for Aboriginal Business.</p>
            <p>This Standing Offer is NOT intended for use when deliveries will
              be made within areas subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements
              (CLCAs).</p>
            <p>B 2.3 Delivery<br>
              The Offeror, or its authorized agent, must make complete delivery
                of each Call-up within </p>
            <p>(a) 15 calendar days for lots of less than 20 photocopiers/MFDs,
              and/or </p>
            <p>(b) 20 calendar days for lots of 20 or more photocopiers/MFDs,
              after receipt of an authorized Call-up unless they have made formal
              arrangements with the Identified User. The Offeror must clearly
              state its best delivery date after receipt of the Call-up.</p>
            <p>If the Offeror is late in delivering any photocopier(s)/MFD(s)
              and/or components ordered on a Call-up, Liquidated Damages will
              apply as specified herein.</p>
            <p>B 2.4 Damage in Transit<br>
              Costs associated with replacement of equipment damaged in transit
                will be borne by the Offeror, and the equipment will not be considered &quot;delivered&quot; for
                the purposes of satisfying the delivery time requirements as
                detailed above, unless the equipment is undamaged and ready for
                acceptance testing. Liquidated damages will apply to product
                that has been determined to be damaged prior to the end of the
                mandatory Delivery Level of Service time frame.</p>
            <p>B 2.5 Discounts for Late Deliveries &amp; Reimbursement of Reprocurement
              Costs</p>
            <p>If the Contractor fails to deliver any Products by the Delivery
              Date and Canada does not terminate the Call-up for default and
              instead provides the Contractor with additional time to make delivery,
              the Contractor agrees to reduce the price of the Products by 5%
              of the total value of the total Fixed Monthly Rate for the Product(s)
              and, where there are Purchased goods, the total purchase price.</p>
            <p>If the Contractor is late in delivering only part of the Products
              ordered on a Call-up, and Canada does not terminate the Call-up
              for default and instead provides the Contractor with additional
              time to make balance of the delivery, the Contractor agrees to
              reduce the FMR or Purchase Price (as applicable) of the Products
              delivered late by 15%, up to a maximum of 5% of the total value
              of the FMR or Purchase Price part of the Call-up.</p>
            <p>These discounts constitute liquidated damages and the Parties
              agree that these amounts are their best pre-estimate of the loss
              to Canada in the event of the defaults described, and that they
              are not a penalty.</p>
            <p>If this Contract is terminated by Canada for default, the Contractor
              must reimburse Canada for any difference in cost between the price
              of the Products and the cost of procuring the Products from another
              supplier.</p>
            <p>To collect the liquidated damages, Canada has the right to hold
              back, drawback, deduct or set off from and against any money Canada
              owes to the Contractor from time to time.</p>
            <p>Nothing in this article limits the rights and remedies to which
              Canada is otherwise entitled under this Contract, the Standing
              Offer, or the law.<br>
                <br>
                B 2.6 Ability to Supply<br>
                In the event that the volume of photocopier(s)/MFD(s) and/or
                Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment, services, or any combination
                thereof, called-up exceeds or threatens to exceed the Offeror's
                ability to supply, the Offeror must advise the PWGSC Standing
                Offer Authority immediately so that the appropriate action can
                be taken. This action may include the designation of the products
                as Inactive or the removal of the Products or Services temporarily
                or permanently from the Best Value Grid. In the case of the aggregate
                Category A, this may necessitate the removal of all of the Offerors
                Products in that Category.</p>
            <p>B 2.7 Shipment and FOB Point<br>
              Shipment is to be consigned FOB including all delivery charges
                to the destination specified.</p>
            <p>For all orders, the cost of delivery including all packaging and
              transportation costs to any location within Canada, with the exception
              of Comprehensive Land Claims Areas, has been included in the lease
              cost(s) of the photocopier(s)/MFD(s) and/or the lease or purchase
              costs of Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment.</p>
            <p>B 2.8 Packing and Shipping of Purchased Items<br>
              For any purchased items, packaging and shipping are to be in accordance
                with the industry standard for the applicable items in order
                to ensure their safe arrival at destination. Packing slips must
                accompany each shipment. The Offeror will be responsible for
                the safe delivery, installation (if required) and obtaining acceptance
                of the Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment at destination.</p>
            <p>All such purchased items will remain the responsibility of the
              Offeror until delivered, installed (if required) and accepted by
              an authorized representative of Canada. Following acceptance of
              the Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment, all charges incurred
              with the replacement of malfunctioning equipment will be borne
              by the Offeror. </p>
            <p>B 2.9 Site Requirements<br>
              The Offeror must provide the Identified User, prior to installation
                under any resulting contract, wiring specifications and special
                environmental conditions, if any, required for the equipment.
                Any alterations to the site will be the responsibility of the
                Identified User. Surge protection and power filtering equipment,
                if required, should be provided with any photocopier/MFD.</p>
            <p>B 2.10 Removal of Packaging<br>
              The Offeror will be responsible for the removal and responsible
                disposal (recycling) of all packaging materials.</p>
