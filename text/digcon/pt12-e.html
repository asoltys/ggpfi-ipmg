            <p>12.0 ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES</p>
            <p>12.1 Promotional/Marketing Literature <br>
              The Offeror agrees and understands that any promotional/marketing
                literature produced as a result of having a Standing Offer and
                for use by the Identified Users must be approved by its PWGSC
                Standing Offer Authority prior to distribution. This includes
                any materials citing the NMSO number that are sent to NMSO Authorized
                Agents for distribution to clients.</p>
            <p>12.2 Withdrawal by PWGSC of Authority to Call-up Against the Standing
              Offer <br>
              If during the course of the Standing Offer the PWGSC Standing Offer
              Authority becomes aware that the Offeror is in violation of the
              terms and conditions of any resulting Standing Offer (e.g., either
              through random inspections or written complaint from any Identified
              user), Canada may set aside use of the Standing Offer, as detailed
              below, for a specified period or for the remainder of the Standing
              Offer Period.</p>
            <p>12.2.1 Causes<br>
              Conditions which may result in the suspension of any resulting
                Standing Offer include:</p>
            <p> (1) Shipment of equipment which is not on the NMSO, or unauthorized
              equipment substitutions;</p>
            <p> (2) Shipment of equipment with an unauthorized change in internal
              components;</p>
            <p>(3) Documented history of chronic late deliveries. The PWGSC Standing
              Offer Authority may meet or correspond with the Offeror's management
              after reported instances of late delivery. If, after meeting or
              corresponding with the Offeror's management, the delivery situation
              is not sufficiently improved, the Standing Offer may be set aside;</p>
            <p>(4) Documented history of chronic poor maintenance service. The
              PWGSC Standing Offer Authority will meet or correspond with the
              Offeror's management after reported instances of poor maintenance
              service. If, after meeting or corresponding with the Offeror's
              management, the maintenance situation is not sufficiently improved,
              the Standing Offer will be set aside;<br>
                <br>
  (5) Violation of any of the specific terms and conditions detailed in the Standing
  Offer.</p>
            <p> (6) Violation of any of the specific terms and conditions detailed
              in any resulting Call-up.</p>
            <p>12.2.2 Remedies<br>
  The first violation of any of the terms and conditions of the NMSO, as detailed
    herein, may result in setting aside the use of the Offeror's Standing Offer
    for a period of three (3) months. Any subsequent violation may result in
    setting aside the use of the Offeror's Offer for the remainder of the Standing
    Offer period.</p>
            <p>Each reported instance of violation will be investigated by the
              PWGSC Standing Offer Authority to confirm that the Offeror is indeed
              in violation of the terms and conditions of any resulting Standing
              Offer. A Standing Offer Committee consisting of the PWGSC Contractual
              Authority and two senior contracting authorities will then determine
              the appropriate course of action. The Offeror will then be informed
              of the findings and course of action determined by the Standing
              Offer Committee.</p>
            <p>12.2.3 Recourse<br>
              If the Offeror does not agree with the ruling of the Standing Offer
                Committee, the Offeror may appeal the decision in writing in
                the following sequence:</p>
            <p>1) PWGSC Standing Offer Authority;<br>
              2) Manager, Acquisitions, PWGSC Pacific Region;<br>
              3) Director, Acquisitions, PWGSC Pacific Region;<br>
              4) Regional Director General, PWGSC Pacific Region.</p>
            <p>12.3 Subsequent Acquisition of a Company or all or part of its
              Business Covered by a Standing Offer<br>
              It sometimes occurs after a Standing Offer has been accepted that
              the company or all or part of its business that is covered by a
              Standing Offer is acquired by another entity and a question arises
              as to how Canada can make call-ups against the original Standing
              Offer. Canada reserves the right in those circumstances to consent
              to an assignment of all or part of the Standing Offer rights to
              the new entity or to simply order directly from the new entity.</p>
            <p>12.4 Creation of New Categories<br>
              PWGSC may, at any time, conduct further Requests for Standing Offers
                for new categories or sub-categories and the resulting offers
                may be incorporated into this Standing Offer. These requirements
                will be subject to an open competition posted on the Government
                Electronic Tendering Service.</p>
            <p>12.5 Expansion of Offerors following Withdrawal of Authority to
              Use Standing Offer<br>
              If the number of Offerors for any given Category or Sub-Category
              is reduced during the Standing Offer Period for any reason (including
              setting aside authority to use a Standing Offer or voluntary withdrawal
              by the Offeror), Canada may, in its sole discretion, do one or
              more of the following in respect of any Category or Sub-Category:</p>
            <p>leave the Category or Sub-Category &quot;as is&quot; (i.e., the
              Standing Offers of the remaining Offerors will remain available
              for Call-ups and no new Offerors will be added);</p>
            <p>call for new Offers in respect of one or more affected Category
              or Sub-Category through the Government Electronic Tendering Service;
              or</p>
            <p>contact the Offeror (if any) whose offered Product complied with
              all the requirements of the Request for Standing Offer that resulted
              in the issuance of this Standing Offer and was &quot;next in line&quot; under
              the evaluation methodology, but who was not issued a Standing Offer,
              and</p>
            <p>in the case of Category A, the new Offeror agrees to meet or better
              the aggregate Value Factor of the existing Products of the Offeror
              whose Standing Offer has been cancelled; or</p>
            <p>in the case of all other Sub-Categories, the new Offeror agrees
              to meet or better the Value Factor in the relevant Sub-Category(ies)
              of the existing Product(s) of the Offeror whose Standing Offer
              has been cancelled; then</p>
            <p>that new Offeror may be issued a Standing Offer in the applicable
              Category or Sub-Category. If the new Offeror does not agree to
              meet or better the Value Factor of the previous Offeror's Product,
              no Standing Offer will be issued to that Offeror and Canada may,
              but will have no obligation to, contact the next-ranked Offeror.<br>
