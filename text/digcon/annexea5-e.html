            </b><b>EZ107-070001/001/VAN to EZ107-070001/011/VAN<br>
FOR THE LEASE OF PHOTOCOPIERS AND MULTIFUNCTION DEVICES (MFDs)</b><strong></strong></p>
            <p>ANNEX A-5  - 
EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS<br>
</p>
            <p>EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS FOR NEW PHOTOCOPIERS/MFDS</p>
            <p>A 5.0 DECONFIGURATION AND RECONFIGURATION</p>
            <p>A 5.1 Deconfiguration of Equipment <br>
  Where the Identified User will be allowed to deconfigure from the NMSO photocopier/MFD
    Configuration to call up an unconnected photocopier only device or equipment
    with different options, the configuration has been broken out to indicate
    the part numbers and rates for each modular piece included in with the sum
    of the parts equaling the total Base FMR for the model quoted. These broken
    out rates must be identical to the rates quoted in the Additional/Reconfiguration
    Equipment - Purchase or Lease section of Annex D, where they must be available
    for reconfiguration.</p>
            <p>The Offeror is not required to quote Breakout pricing but must
              not supply less than the NMSO photocopier/MFD Configuration for
              any Call-up against any resulting Standing Offer unless the rates
              are broken out in their offer.</p>
            <p>A 5.1.1 Hard Drives <br>
  Where the hard drive of a photocopier is removable and to enable Identified
    Users with security concerns to request the removal of the hard drive at
    the end of their lease, Offerors must break out the hard drive in the Deconfigured
    Pricing and have it available as a Purchase Priced option in the Additional/Reconfiguration
    Equipment listings. The purchase price must include all services costs to
    remove the hard drive at the end of the lease, if applicable. </p>
            <p>While it is not required that the Hard Drive be removable or that
              the Offeror quote a price for removal and purchase, Identified
              Users may use this factor to determine whether or not the photocopier/MFD
              meets their functional security requirements in determination of
              their Best Value.</p>
            <p>A 5.2 Reconfiguration of Equipment<br>
  Modular equipment added to form the NMSO Configuration as per the specifications
    of the sub-category and broken out in the Breakout for Unconnected or Deconfigured
    Lease rates of the NMSO Configuration must also be quoted the Additional
    Equipment - Purchase or Lease section of Annex D to allow the Identified
    User to reconfigure the installed photocopier/MFD at a later date. The Fixed
    Monthly Rates for Reconfiguration Equipment must be the same as the FMR broken
    out in the NMSO Configuration. However, Professional Services charges may
    apply for the field reconfiguration of any equipment as per Article A 5.6,
    following. A purchase price may also be quoted for Reconfiguration Equipment. </p>
            <p>A 5.3 Additional Equipment - Purchase or Lease<br>
  The Offeror may offer additional equipment other than that required by the
    specifications, which attaches directly to or is used by the new photocopier/MFD
    offered. The Offeror must offer this equipment at the Fixed Monthly Rates
    quoted in Annex C. Purchase pricing may also be offered but is not required.
    Where the Offeror can present adequate justification (third party software
    licensing, etc.), Additional Equipment may be quoted with purchase prices
    only. When purchase prices only are quoted, the Offeror may not supply this
    equipment or software on a lease basis as part of any Call-up.</p>
            <p>Pricing quoted for these options does not form part of the Evaluated
              Cost in the evaluation, although Canada reserves the right to perform
              a pricing audit on any optional equipment and to reject any equipment
              that do not meet the criteria of Good Value to Canada or for which
              there is not an acceptable reason for quoting purchase prices only.</p>
            <p>Offerors are not permitted to offer additional print controllers
              for the reconfiguration of NMSO offered equipment.</p>
            <p>The Offeror may apply to add Additional Equipment at any time
              during the Standing Offer period for inclusion during the following
              Refresh Date, but agrees that no Additional Equipment will be shipped
              until formally authorized by the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority
              in writing.</p>
            <p>A 5.4 Call-up of Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment<br>
  Reconfiguration and Additional Equipment may be called up from the Standing
    Offer at any time for installation on the installed new or renewal photocopier(s)/MFD(s).
    This equipment may be purchased outright if the Offeror has quoted a purchase
    price in Annex D or DR of their Standing Offer or the equipment may be leased
    at the rates quoted in Annex D or DR. </p>
            <p>Deconfiguration/Reconfiguration Equipment quoted (or equal) must
              be available for Call-up during the full Period of the Standing
              Offer. </p>
            <p>All Additional Equipment that is purchased must include a minimum
              one year on-site warranty and will be installed by the Offeror
              and removed by the Offeror at the end of the Commitment Period
              of the photocopier/MFD onto which it is installed. It will remain
              the property of the Identified User.</p>
            <p>The Commitment Period for the lease of Additional or Reconfiguration
              Equipment must not extend past the Commitment Period of the new
              or renewal photocopier/MFD to which it will be attached and this
              Commitment Period may be extended in the same ways as that of the
              photocopier/MFD (Part 6 B 5.2). Termination Fees may be applicable
              if Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment is removed before the
              end of the Commitment Period as per Part 6 B 5.4.</p>
            <p>A 5.5 Call-up of Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment in Nonstandard
              Commitment Periods<br>
  For periods other than the stated Commitment Periods, the Offeror may negotiate
  with the Identified User to determine the most advantageous rate to Canada.
  At no time will the rate for the Reconfiguration or Upgrade Equipment exceed
  the rate of the nearest full Commitment Period for the equipment.</p>
            <p>A 5.6 Professional Services for Field Installed Additional and
              Reconfiguration Equipment <br>
  When Reconfiguration Equipment is subsequently added back to the installed
  configuration or when Additional Equipment is installed subsequent to the initial
  Call-up (&quot;field installation&quot;), or when Reconfiguration Equipment
  is added to a Renewal photocopier/MFD, the Offeror will have the right to add
  an additional charge equaling up to one (1) hour of Installation and/or Configuration,
  one (1) hour of Systems Integration and two (2) hours of User Training to the
  Call-up at the rates quoted in the Professional Services section of Annex D.</p>
            <p>Any additional Professional Services must be listed on the Call-up
              document for the Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment. Additional
              Professional Services must not be provided without the written
              permission of the Identified User.</p>
            <p>Rates quoted for these professional services do not form part
              of the Evaluated Cost in the evaluation, although Canada reserves
              the right to perform a pricing audit on any professional services
              rates and to reject any professional services rates that do not
              meet the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
