            RFSO BENCHMARK TESTING</p>
            <p>J 1.0 OVERVIEW<br>
              The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation.
                It is used to generate a score based on the performance (speed),
                quality of output, features and usability of the photocopier/MFD.
                This score is used in the determination of Value for Dollar in
                the Financial Evaluation. The data generated through the benchmark
                testing will be posted on the Imaging Product Management Group
                Internet site to assist Identified Users in their purchasing
                decisions.</p>
            <p>While generally only technically compliant equipment of technically
              compliant Offerors is tested,<br>
              Offerors with outstanding compliance issues may request to have
              their photocopier(s)/MFD(s) tested. Should the issues not be resolved
              by the end of the testing period, the equipment will be eliminated
              and any Benchmark fees paid will be forfeited.</p>
            <p>J 2.0 Benchmark General Provisions</p>
            <p>J 2.1 The following Benchmark Procedures have been established
              in cooperation with the testing authority, NSTL Canada Corp. All
              questions and concerns about these procedures must be addressed
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority named in the RFSO.</p>
            <p>J 2.2 The Offeror agrees and understands that benchmark tests
              on equipment offered are mandatory and will be conducted prior
              to the final financial evaluation.</p>
            <p>J 3.0 Benchmark Fee</p>
            <p>J 3.1 Benchmark tests will be conducted by NSTL Canada Corp. All
              costs associated with the benchmark testing will be at the Offeror's
              expense. </p>
            <p>J 3.2 The Offeror understands and agrees that the cost for each
              photocopier/MFD submitted for testing will be in accordance with
              the Schedule of Benchmark Costs identified herein, and is payable
              by certified cheque made out to NSTL.</p>
            <p>J 4.0 Previous Test Data</p>
            <p>J 4.1 If a photocopier/MFD offered under this RFSO has previously
              been tested by NSTL for other requirements, any applicable test
              data may be used. The applicability of data from previous testing
              will be determined by NSTL. Decisions by NSTL will be final in
              this respect. </p>
            <p>J 4.2 An administration fee will be required to cover the costs
              of recompiling and posting the data for the new requirement. At
              no time will the fee be in excess of the benchmark test fee identified
              for the photocopier/MFD in Annex P.</p>
            <p>J 5.0 Call to Benchmark Testing<br>
              Benchmark tests will be conducted at the NSTL test site located
                in the National Capital Region, Ontario, Canada.</p>
            <p>J 6.0 Benchmark Test Schedule</p>
            <p>J 6.1 Offerors will be notified by e-mail and/or facsimile of
              the Benchmark Test Schedule, with a minimum of seven (7) calendar
              days notice. </p>
            <p>J 6.2 Notification will include the schedule of delivery dates

              payments required for the benchmark tests.</p>
            <p>J 6.3 Failure to deliver the equipment and other items on the
              specified date(s) and time may result in disqualification.</p>

              of the offered model.</p>
            <p>J 7.6 The unit tested must be identical to the unit priced in
              Annex C - Financial Details, unless a formal change is requested
              to provide a configuration of the model offered that exceeds the

            <p>J 7.7 No substitutes will be accepted unless approved by PWGSC
              prior to commencement of the benchmark testing.</p>
            <p>J 8.0 Installation and Configuration - Benchmark Testing</p>
            <p>J 8.1 It is the Offeror's responsibility to install, setup and
              test the equipment at the site prior to benchmark testing. Moreover,
              the following condition must be respected by any Offeror:</p>
            <p> J 8.1.1 It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that equipment
              is delivered to the Benchmark test site on the appointed date,
              more than three (3) hours prior to 5:00 pm EST.</p>
            <p>J 9.0 Set up Time</p>
            <p>J 9.1 The Offeror will not be permitted more than 3.0 hours to
              set up each machine.</p>
            <p>J 9.2 Offerors setting up more than 1 machine are expected to
              bring sufficient staff to complete all setup according to the following
              guidelines</p>
            <p>4 hours for up to 8 machines,<br>
              8 hours for up to 16 machines, and <br>
              12 hours for over 16 machines. </p>
            <p>J 9.3 NSTL reserves the right to limit setup time beyond these
              guidelines. </p>
            <p>J 10.0 Inadequate or Malfunctioning Equipment</p>
            <p>J 10.1 If the equipment does not function in compliance with the
              specifications, or is found to be different from the photocopier/MFD
              described in Annex C - Technical Details, it will be removed, and
              a new appointment will be made at that time to deliver an operational
              and/or compliant photocopier/MFD within 2 working days. </p>
            <p>J 10.2 If the equipment delivered exceeds the specifications as
              described in Annex C - Technical Details and/or Annex D - Financial
              Details, the Offeror must reconfigure the equipment to meet the
              specifications of the equipment offered or apply for a formal change

              shown in Annex D.</p>
            <p>J 10.3 If the Offeror is not able to deliver a compliant operational
              photocopier/MFD by the time set for the second appointment, or
              the photocopier/MFD does not function in compliance with the specifications
              following delivery and setup, or the equipment that was delivered
              does not meet or exceed the description offered in Annex A, the
              photocopier/MFD will be disqualified.</p>
            <p>J 10.4 In the event that the equipment does not function in accordance
              with the requirements of the benchmark testing procedures, the
              Offeror will be required to repair or replace the malfunctioning
              equipment (with the equipment proposed) within 2 working days of
              notification.</p>
            <p>J 10.5 If, on expiry of this 2 working day period, the equipment

              (2) if another fault is identified, or<br>
              (3) if the Offeror fails to meet the 2 working day deadline,</p>
            <p>the equipment will be eliminated from further consideration.</p>
            <p>J 10.6 Upon request, NSTL will demonstrate any fault found during
              the benchmark tests. </p>
            <p>J 10.7 Canada is not obliged to accept benchmark data from any
              or all equipment proposed.</p>
            <p>J 10.8 Failure to comply with the benchmark test procedures specified
              herein may result in disqualification of an offer without further
