            <p>A 1.0 MANDATORY GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS</p>
            <p>All photocopiers/MFDs offered, under all sub-categories, must
              meet or exceed the following Mandatory General Specifications:</p>
            <p>A 1.1 All photocopiers/MFDs offered must use digital electrophotographic
              printing technology, stationary printhead inkjet printing technology,
              solid ink printing technology, or equivalent, to produce output
              from normal and complex office automation applications such as
              word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, and a combination of text
              and graphics on the same page.</p>
            <p>A 1.2 NMSO configuration multifunction devices must be configured
              as a network printer with walk-up photocopier capabilities, able
              to produce multiple prints from both the document feeder and the

              port and the capacity to add or substitute at least one of the
              following: parallel, serial, AppleTalk, Token Ring, USB, Bluetooth
              or 802.11b wireless LAN.</p>
            <p>A 1.3 All photocopiers/MFDs must be capable of double-sided printing
              and copying from all required paper input sources and in all required
              paper sizes. The photocopier/MFDs must be set either at the factory
              or when delivered to the Identified User, to default to print doubled-sided
              and to make two sided copies from single sided originals (Default
              Duplex). If the Identified User does not wish, for operational
              reasons, to have the device default to duplex either for print
              or for photocopying, the Offeror (or their Agent or subcontractor)
              must have the Identified User sign off that they have been offered
              but have refused this functionality. A list of Identified Users
              refusing this functionality must be available as a report upon
              demand by the Standing Offer Authority.</p>

              Security Evaluation (ISO 15408) Version 3.1 dated September 2006
              as a basis for its security functional requirements for the Standing
              Offer.</p>
            <p>To achieve the evaluation reduction, the proposed equipment must
              be certified to at least EAL2 (Evaluation Assurance Level 2) for
              the following requirements with given CC SFR reference numbers,
              and meet the &quot;Additional Security Requirements&quot; below.
              The Target of Evaluation (TOE) must be the photocopier/MFD itself
              and/or a security kit that is added to the photocopier/MFD as an
              accessory. If the TOE is an accessory such as a security kit, then
              this accessory must be included as part of the NMSO configuration
              of the photocopier/MFD.</p>
            <p>a) Residual Information Protection</p>
            <p>FDP_RIP.1.1: The TSF (TOE Security Functions) shall ensure that
              any previous information content of a resource is made unavailable
              upon the de-allocation of the resource from the following objects:
              Hard Disk Drive and any other non-volatile storage components.</p>
            <p>b) User identification and Authentication</p>
            <p>FIA_UID.2.1: The TSF shall require each user to be successfully
              identified before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf
              of that user.</p>
            <p>FIA_UAU.2.1 The TSF shall require each user to be successfully
              authenticated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on
              behalf of that user.</p>
            <p>c) Security Audit Data Generation</p>
            <p>FAU_GEN.1.1: The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record

            <p>FAU_GEN.1.2: The TSF shall record within each audit record at
              least the following information: Date and time of the event, type
              of event, subject identity and the outcome (success or failure)
              of the event.</p>
            <p>d) Additional Security Requirements (not required to be EAL certified):</p>
            <p>i.) Triple Data Overwrite</p>
            <p>Each proposed MFD must have a triple overwrite capability for
              residual data which must be executed to the Identified User's satisfaction
              prior to removal of the hard drive (and any other non-volatile
              memory components which may contain Identified User's job data)
              from the Identified User's premises, or, alternatively, the hard
              drive (and other non-volatile storage components) must be surrendered
              to the Identified User for physical destruction if it is defective
              or otherwise no longer required for use within the Identified User's
              environment.</p>
            <p>ii.) Network and Analog Fax Resource Separation</p>
            <p>Access to the local or wide area network and data through the
              fax telephone line/modem interface must not be possible. The fax
