            <p>5.0 EXPIRATION, EXTENSION, AND TERMINATION</p>
            <p>5.1 Expiration Notice<br>
              The Offeror must notify the Identified User a minimum of ninety
                (90) days before the expiration date of any contract. This reminder
                will allow for a timely reassessment of the end user's printing
                and copying requirements.</p>
            <p>5.2 Extending the Commitment Period<br>
              Where the original Commitment Period was 2, 3, or 4 years, Canada
                may, at its option, through contract amendment, change the Commitment
                Period to a Commitment Period of longer duration at any time
                during the Standing Offer period, and the total FMR and CPC Rate
                associated with the revised Commitment Period will be applicable
                to all months of the new Commitment Period, including those months
                that the equipment has already been installed with any overpayment
                to date to be credited against future costs; but in no event
                will the recalculated amount to the date of the change exceed
                the amount already paid. The Installation Date of the new Commitment
                Period must be the same as the installation date of the original.</p>
            <p>5.3 Ninety (90) Day Extension at end of Period and Extension after
              Standing Offer Expires<br>
              Where the original Commitment Period was 2, 3, 4 or 5 years, Canada
              may at its option, through Contract Amendment, (PWGSC 942) extend
              a Commitment Period for a period of up to ninety (90) days at the
              same or a lower Total FMR and CPC Rate than that associated with
              the Commitment Period prior to such extension.</p>
            <p>In the event that an Offeror is not, for any reason whatsoever,
              granted a Standing Offer for the period subsequent to the period
              of the Standing Offer and in order to avoid administrative chaos
              and inconvenience Canada may at its option, through Amendment to
              the Call-up, extend a Commitment Period for a period of up to one
              (1) year at the same or a lower Total FMR and CPC Rate than that
              associated with the Commitment Period prior to such extension.</p>
            <p>5.4 Termination<br>
              Canada may at its option, with two weeks notice, terminate the
                use of any installed photocopier/MFD, where such termination
                would take effect at the end of the month following the two week
                notice period subject to the following conditions:</p>
            <p>5.4.1 Termination Fees<br>
              Where the termination takes place prior to the completion of the
                applicable Commitment Period, then Canada will pay a fixed Termination
                Fee. The Contractor may choose to, but is not obliged to, waive
                or reduce this Termination Fee in the event of a subsequent Call-up
                for new equipment. In no case will the Termination Fee be added
                to the new Call-up.</p>
            <p>The Termination Fee will be equal to the difference between the
              actual amount paid to-date and an Adjusted Amount. The Adjusted
              Amount will be calculated as following:</p>
            <p>(1) where the original Commitment Period was 2, 3, 4 or 5 years
              and the actual period of installation was less than 24 months,
              then the Adjusted Amount will be based on the rates associated
              with a TWO (2) Year Commitment Period multiplied by 24 months;
              but in no event will the Termination Fee exceed the balance of
              the Fixed Monthly Rate that would have been due had the lease not
              been terminated;</p>
            <p>(2) where the original Commitment Period was 3, 4 or 5 years and
              where the actual period of installation was less than 36 months,
              then the Adjusted Amount will be based on the rates associated
              with a TWO (2) Year Commitment Period multiplied by the actual
              number of months that the equipment was installed; but in no event
              will the Termination Fee exceed the amount that would have been
              due for 36 months using the Fixed Monthly Rate for a THREE (3)
              Year Commitment Period, or exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly
              Rate that would have been due had the lease not been terminated.</p>
            <p>(3) where the original Commitment Period was 4 or 5 years and
              where the actual period of installation was less than 48 months,
              then the Adjusted Amount will be based on the rates associated
              with a THREE (3) Year Commitment Period multiplied by the actual
              number of months that the equipment was installed; but in no event
              will the Termination Fee exceed the amount that would have been
              due for 48 months using the Fixed Monthly Rate for a FOUR (4) YEAR
              Commitment Period or exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate
              that would have been due had the lease not been terminated.</p>
            <p>(4) where the original Commitment Period was 5 years and where
              the actual period of installation was less than 60 months, then
              the Adjusted Amount will be based on the rates associated with
              a FOUR (4) Year Commitment Period multiplied by the actual number
              of months that the equipment was installed; but in no event will
              the Termination Fee exceed the balance of the Fixed Monthly Rate
              that would have been due had the Commitment Period not been terminated.</p>
            <p>5.4.2 Removal of Additional or Reconfiguration Equipment<br>
              Should the Identified User wish to remove Additional or Reconfiguration
                Equipment prior to the completion of the applicable Commitment
                Period for that equipment, this is not considered a termination
                of the base unit. However, the Offeror may charge a termination
                fee for the option(s) removed that will be determined in the
                same way as for the base machinery but with the Adjusted Amount
                to be determined from the FMR of the optional equipment only.
                There will be no additional Professional Services charges for
                the removal of equipment.</p>
            <p>5.4.3 Termination of a Photocopier/MFD during Renewal Periods<br>
              Where an installed photocopier/MFD is in a renewal period and where
                the photocopier/MFD has been installed for more than five (5)
                years, and where the Identified User can show documented evidence
                of excessive downtime or reduction of functionality, the Renewal
                Contract may be terminated with a minimum of thirty days notice
                and no Termination Fees will apply.</p>
            <p></p>
