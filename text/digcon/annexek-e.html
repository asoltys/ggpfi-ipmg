                Personnel which meet the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern

            <p>K 4.7 Provision of Training<br>
              The Offeror must provide on-site training in the operation of the

                the Identified User, as per Annex B 5.1 of this RFSO. The cost
                of this service will be included in the Base Fixed Monthly Rate

            <p>This section must include a schedule and description of preventive

            <p>Proposed maintenance solutions will be evaluated in terms of approach
              to assure that the equipment will be maintained in a fashion that

                they must have a good history of performance in reporting from
                these Standing Offers.<br>
              <br>
              This section must describe in detail the process that the Offeror
              will use to gather the data required for the reports detailed in
              Part 6 A 3.2 and Annex B 5.7 of this RFSO and provide sample copies
              of the report format.</p>
            <p>Poor reporting performance for other Standing Offers may result
              in this offer being declared non-responsive.<br>
            </p>
            <p>K 5.0 EQUIPMENT PROPOSAL</p>
            <p>PRICING INFORMATION MUST NOT BE INCLUDED WITH THE EQUIPMENT PROPOSAL.
              Financial information must be submitted only as a part of the FINANCIAL
              PROPOSAL in a separate package.<br>
                <br>
                The Equipment Proposal for this RFSO must contain all of the
                forms, certifications, registrations and proofs detailed below. </p>
            <p>K 5.1 Equipment Offered <br>
              The Offeror must offer photocopiers/MFDs meeting various specifications
                to fulfill digital connected printing and/or photocopying requirements.</p>
            <p>The Offeror is permitted to offer only one model of photocopier/MFD
              in an individual sub-category for New Equipment. In other words,
              the Offeror is not permitted to offer more than one model in any
              New Equipment sub-category.</p>
            <p>A model of photocopier/MFD can be offered in one sub-category
              only. The Offeror is not permitted to offer the same model in more
              than one sub-category.</p>
            <p>Category A will be evaluated on an aggregate basis, therefore
              the Offeror must offer a product in each sub-category of Category
              A in order to be considered for that category. All other categories
              will be evaluated on an individual sub-category basis, therefore
              the Offeror is not required to offer a product all of the sub-categories
              of any other category.</p>
            <p>A product may be offered as a Renewal product only if it was offered
              in a previous NMSO.</p>
            <p>K 5.2 Equipment Proposal Details<br>
              The Offeror's Equipment Proposal must contain the following for
                each photocopier/MFD offered:</p>
            <p>K 5.2.1 (from the secure web site) a completed and printed Annex
              C - Technical Details - for the sub-category into which the photocopier/MFD
              is offered, giving a full description of the photocopier/MFD and
              a complete list of deliverables (without prices), including the
              Manufacturer's name(s) and OEM Part Number. The Offeror must provide
              the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM's) name and part number
              even if the Offeror normally uses their own part number for the
              proposed product.</p>
            <p>K 5.2.2 (on the printed Annex C) the Offerors' signed statement
              of the photocopier/MFD's compliance to all specifications detailed
              in Annex A - Equipment Specifications for that sub-category. Products
              found to be non-compliant to the specifications during or after
              benchmark testing will be eliminated and any benchmark fees paid
              are forfeited. Wherever applicable, the Offeror must provide supporting
              evidence of its compliance including copies of all required certifications.</p>
            <p>K 5.2.3 a full set of appropriate technical documentation, (specification
              sheets and technical brochures, etc.) describing the photocopier/MFD
              and its components as proposed in the Technical Details. This must

              (for each copy of the Offer), either in bilingual version (English
              and French) or in English and in French for separate language versions,
              for each model offered.</p>
            <p>If this documentation is available from an Internet site, the
              complete current Internet address must be provided along with printouts
              of the information available.</p>
            <p>It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that the submitted
              technical documentation provides sufficient detail to support the
              certification that the proposed product meets the requirements
              of the technical specifications. If the location of the supporting
              information in technical documentation is not immediately obvious,
              the Offeror should highlight or otherwise direct the evaluation
              team to the relevant information in the specification sheet.</p>
            <p>For prerelease or newly released product where this material may
              not yet be created, the Offeror must provide as much technical
              information as is available and must submit the information as
              soon as it becomes available. The onus is on the vendor to assure

              all photocopiers/MFDs offered have been received by the Standing
              Offer Authority before the end of the evaluation period. Products
              for which this information has not been received within these time
              frames will be deemed non-responsive and removed from further consideration.</p>
            <p> K 5.2.4 for each product offered, the Offeror must provide proof
              of all required certifications or registrations, including:</p>
            <p>(1) proof of electrical certification through an agency accredited
              by the Standards Council of Canada (see Annex A 4.5) for all proposed
              photocopiers/MFDs;</p>

            <p>(3) proof of registration to ISO (International Standardization
              Organization) 9001:2000 for the Offeror's (or the Offeror's OEM)
              manufacturing facility where the proposed photocopier/MFD is manufactured/assembled. </p>
            <p>One registration may serve for more than one model as long as
              the Offeror specifies clearly which models were produced at each
              facility.</p>
            <p>K 5.2.5 proof of English and French or bilingual (English and
              French) user and technical manuals. This proof must be in the form
              of copies of the indexes of the required manuals.</p>
            <p>English language sser and technical manuals will be verified at
              the benchmark test site.</p>
            <p>It is mandatory that the Offeror furnish all manuals provided
              with the proposed equipment when called to bench test as these
              manuals form an essential part of the usability evaluation.</p>
            <p>During the benchmark period, upon request, the Offeror must produce
              the French or bilingual (English and French) version of any required
              documentation. Failure to provide manuals in French within three
              (3) business days from the date of the request may result in the
              disqualification of the photocopier/MFD for which manuals are missing.
              All benchmark fees paid will be forfeited.</p>
            <p>Translated user manuals that are not identical to the original
              version in terms of information content and comparable in quality
              and finish may be considered non-compliant and the photocopier/MFD
              associated with them may be eliminated from consideration.</p>

            <p>The Contractor must control electronic waste through the establishment
              of an ongoing hardware take-back and recycling program. </p>
            <p>At the end of any lease, the Contractor must take back any leased
              products supplied under any Call-ups at no charge.</p>
            <p>The Contractor must recycle or dispose of all equipment taken
              back in an environmentally sensitive manner. At a minimum, the
              recycling of equipment should involve material recovery and metals
              recovery processes.&nbsp;Facilities used to process end of life
              electronics must meet all applicable health, safety, environment,
              transport and export regulations. Facilities must possess all required
              permits and appropriate insurance.</p>
            <p>Acceptable processes include manual dismantling and sorting into
              major material categories (non-hazardous materials, electronic
              scrap materials, and hazardous materials) and mechanical processing
              for dismantling and/or material separation, with provision of dust
              collection and operator risk assessments and protection.</p>
            <p>Major Material categories are defined as follows:</p>

              Export and Import of <br>
              Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulation (EIHWHRMR).</p>
            <p>In the event that it is determined by Canada that an Offeror is
              refusing to take back product or not recycling that product in
              accordance with the minimum requirements of the standing offer,
              Canada will arrange to have the subject material recovered and
              disposed off appropriately at the cost of the Offeror. In addition,
              the Offeror will have their standing offer deauthorized and will
              be excluded from holding a similar standing offer with Canada for
              a minimum of one year from the date of determination.<br>
            </p>
            <p>d) Packaging Recycling<br>
              The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established
                and ongoing packaging recycling program as per the following:</p>
            <p>All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped must
              be recyclable. </p>
            <p>The Offeror must take back all packaging from the Identified User's
              site at the time of product installation.</p>
            <p>The Contractor must reuse, recycle or dispose of all packaging
              materials removed from Products delivered under any Call-up in
              an environmentally sensitive manner.</p>
            <p>e) Energy Star Registration<br>
              The Offeror's product must be Energy Star qualified at the time
                of product acceptance. The vendor must Ship all products with
                the Energy Star low-power feature activated or enabled. This
                eliminates the need for users to configure the power-management
                feature after delivery and helps to ensure that they use the
                energy-saving feature.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Supporting documentation for the Mandatory Environmental Programs
              must be provided with the Offer.</p>
            <p> K 5.3.2 Point Rated Environmental Programs</p>
            <p>The Offeror will receive credit, in the form of percentage reductions
              against the evaluation cost of each product, for having the following
              environmental program in place.</p>
            <p>(a) Third Party Environmental Performance Labeling (3%)<br>
              The photocopier/MFD must be approved for Environmental Ecolabeling
                Certification. Acceptable programs are those that conform to
                ISO 14024 : 1999, Environmental labels and declarations, Type
                I environmental labeling and are recognized by the Global Ecolabeling
                Network (GEN)</p>
            <p>If the photocopier/MFD proposed does not have Environmental Ecolabeling
              Certification at time of initial offer but achieves certification
              subsequent to Standing Offer issue, the Offeror may submit a request
              and proof of certification for the additional reduction at any
              pricing refresh period.</p>
            <p>To apply for the evaluation reductions, the Offeror must complete
              the Environmental Programs fields of the appropriate Annex C -
              Technical Details and Annex D - Financial Details. A percentage
              reduction to the Evaluated Price will be calculated using this
              information and will form part of the Financial Evaluation.</p>
            <p>Care must be taken that certificates/registrations are current.</p>
            <p>Offerors who are in the process of achieving the Point Rated Environmental
              Programs certifications and registrations are not required to submit
              their certification for these programs at the time of offer submission.
              They must, however, indicate that they are in the process of certifying
              or registering and will have until the end of the bench marking
              period to submit their certificates in support of the reductions.
              This will be approximately 5 weeks after tender close. The Offeror
              will be given three (3) days business days notification before
              any pending certificates are due.</p>
            <p>If supporting documentation for any Point Rated Environmental
              Programs is not provided or not found to be acceptable, no reduction
              will be made for that program until adequate proof is provided.
              Once Standing Offers are in place, Offerors can submit requests
              for additional reductions based on compliance to the above programs
              at any time.</p>
            <p>K 5.4 Point Rated Security Requirement<br>
              The Offeror will receive credit, in the form of a 2% reduction
                of evaluation cost of each product meeting the security specifications
                detailed in Annex A 1.13.<br>
