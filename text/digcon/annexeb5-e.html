            <p>(a) Standing Offer and call-up number;<br>
  (b) client's name, telephone number and location;<br>

  (k) remarks.</p>
            <p>Copies of these report must be made available to the Standing
              Offer Authority within thirty (30) days of request.</p>
            <p><a name="b58"></a>B 5.8 Level of Service <br>
  The Offeror warrants and guarantees that the equipment furnished under this
    Standing Offer will perform at the contracted average monthly volume with
    the loss of print or copy service of not more than an aggregate equivalent
    of:</p>
            <p>For Zone A - Major Centres: eight (8) Identified User normal working
              hours per month consisting of twenty (20) eight (8) hour days,
              due to either breakdown or preventive maintenance. This will ensure
              95% availability in a normal user month. In those instances where
              Identified Users employ equipment for longer working days, 95%
              availability must still be met.</p>
            <p>For Zone B - Areas Outside of the Major Centres: sixteen (16)
              Identified User normal working hours per month consisting of twenty
              (20) eight (8) hour days, due to either breakdown or preventive
              maintenance. This will ensure 90% availability in a normal user
              month. In those instances where Identified Users employ equipment
              for longer working days, 90% availability must still be met.</p>
            <p>For Zone C - Remote Locations: twenty-four (24) Identified User
              normal working hours per month consisting of twenty (20) eight
              (8) hour days, due to either breakdown or preventive maintenance.
              This will ensure 85% availability in a normal user month. In those
              instances where Identified Users employ equipment for longer working
              days, 85% availability must still be met.</p>
            <p>The Offeror will be informed by the Identified User of requirements
              exceeding normal working hours.</p>
            <p>Such aggregate downtime is to commence at the time of notifying
              the Offeror in the case of a problem or at start of shutdown in
              the case of preventive maintenance and is to end when print and/or
              copy service is restored. Where the user requests, receives and
              pays for overtime<br>
  servicing, such hours will be excluded. Individual cases involving loss of
  service in excess of the above norm in any one month, leading to serious disruption
  of work, must be brought to the attention of the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority
  named in Part 6 A 5.1 and the Offeror must take necessary steps to rectify
  the situation. In the event that the Offeror does not respond to the satisfaction
  of the user within two (2) weeks from the date the excessive downtime commenced,
  the Offeror will be deemed in default and the Minister will have the right
  to the Remedies described in Annex B 6.4.</p>
            <p><a name="b59"></a>B 5.9 Site Regulations (On-site Service)<br>

    regulations, in force on the site where the work is to be performed, relating
    to the safety of persons on the site or the protection of property against
    loss or damage from any and all causes including fire.</p>
            <p><a name="b510"></a>B 5.10 Licensing<br>
  The Offeror must obtain and maintain all permits, licenses and certificates
    of approval required for the Work to be performed under any applicable federal,
