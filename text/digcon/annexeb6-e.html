            <p>B 6.0 REMEDIES FOLLOWING UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SERVICE</p>
            <p>B 6.1 General<br>
  To ensure a continuing acceptable level of service for the Identified User's
    workload, the Offeror agrees that Canada may exercise the following remedial
    actions.</p>
            <p>The failure of Canada to exercise any or all of the following
              remedies does not mean that the service received conforms with
              the applicable mandatory requirements, nor will that failure lower
              the level of service acceptable for any portion of the Standing
              Offer.</p>
            <p>The Offeror will not be responsible for any deficiencies arising
              from any use of the equipment by the Identified User that is inconsistent
              with practices or procedures published by the OEM or any other
              procedure previously published by the Offeror and accepted by the
              Identified User.</p>
            <p>It is not the intention of Canada to enforce the following remedies
              for situations resulting from acts of God, civil insurrection,
              or in general, factors beyond the reasonable control of the Offeror. </p>
            <p>Application of any of the remedies detailed below in one or more
              instances will not prevent Canada from terminating for default
              in any instance of nonconformity with the terms of the Standing
              Offer.</p>
            <p>The application of any remedy will not result in any increase
              in liability to Canada.</p>
            <p>B 6.2 Process to Claim Remedy<br>
  The Identified User must claim the applicable of any remedy, in writing, within
    30 days from the time that the failure resulting in the application of the
    remedy could reasonably be noted by the Identified User.</p>
            <p>Any such claim for a remedy must include reasonable documentation
              to support such claim.</p>
            <p>Where the application of any remedy results in a financial benefit
              in favour of Canada, then such financial benefit will be applied
              as a credit to the applicable invoice for the billing period following
              the billing period in which the claim was received by the Offeror.</p>
            <p>Where the application of any remedy results in the requirement
              of the Offeror to replace equipment, then such replacement equipment
              must be installed within 24 hours of receipt of the claim, by the
              Offeror.</p>
            <p>Where the application of any remedy results in the requirement
              of the Offeror to provide additional reports or other documentation,
              then such reports or other written documentation must be provided
              within 30 days of receipt of the claim, by the Offeror.</p>
            <p>B 6.3 Definitions<br>
&quot;Remedial Equipment Failure&quot; means any equipment malfunction that requires
remedial maintenance to be provided by the Offeror in order to make the equipment
operational.</p>
            <p>&quot;Unscheduled Equipment Outage&quot; means the period of time
              that equipment is unavailable to the Identified User where such
              unavailability is caused by a Remedial Equipment Failure such period
              will commence when the Offeror is informed of the Remedial Equipment
              Failure in accordance with the Standing Offer.</p>
            <p>B 6.4 Actual Remedies</p>
            <p>B 6.4.1 Excessive Equipment Failure<br>
  In the event any given photocopier/MFD has 3 or more Remedial Equipment Failures

    same or like equipment.</p>
            <p>B 6.4.2 Failure to Repair Equipment <br>

    during the PPM, the Offeror must replace the equipment.</p>
            <p>B 6.4.3 Excessive Outage<br>
  In the event that the Total Unscheduled Equipment Outage exceeds the response
    timeframes stipulated by Zone during the PPM, in any given call, for any
    given photocopier/MFD, the charges associated with that photocopier/MFD will
    be reduced in accordance with the following formula:</p>
