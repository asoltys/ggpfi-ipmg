            <p>2.3 Modifications to the General Conditions<br>
              The General Conditions PWGSC-TPSGC 9601 (2001/05/25) are hereby
                modified as follows:</p>
            <p>Modification #1</p>
            <p>Section 22 of PWGSC-TPSGC 9601 (Indemnity Against Third-party
              Claims), is deleted.<br>
              The following articles (2.3.1 and 2.3.2) are inserted in place
              of the above mentioned deleted section:</p>
            <p> 2.3.1 Intellectual Property Right Infringement</p>
            <p>(1) If a third party claims that equipment or software that the
              Offeror provides under the Standing Offer infringes any intellectual
              property right, the Offeror, if requested to do so by Canada, will
              defend Canada against the claim at the Offeror's expense. In this
              regard, the Offeror will pay all costs, damages and legal fees
              that a court finally awards, provided that Canada:</p>
            <p>a) promptly notifies the Offeror in writing of the claim; and</p>
            <p>b) cooperates with the Offeror in, and allows the Offeror full
              participation in, the defence and related settlement negotiations;
              and</p>
            <p>c) obtains the Offeror's prior approval to any agreement resulting
              from settlement negotiations held with the third party.</p>
            <p>The Offeror will participate in any claims, action or proceeding
              arising under Subsection (1), and no such claim, action or proceeding
              will be settled without the prior written approval of the Offeror
              and Canada.</p>
            <p>(2) If such a claim is made or appears likely to be made, Canada
              agrees to permit the Offeror to enable Canada at the Offeror's
              expense, to continue to use the equipment or software or to modify
              or replace it with equipment or software which has published specifications
              equal or superior to the equipment or software being replaced.
              If the Offeror determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably
              available, Canada may elect, at the Offeror's expense, to independently
              secure the right to continue to use the equipment or software,
              or Canada may require the Offeror to accept the return of the equipment
              or software and to refund all monies paid to the Offeror under
              the Standing Offer for the equipment and software, as well as all
              amounts paid for services and license and development fees.</p>
            <p>(3) The provisions of Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in
              situations where the Offeror was instructed by Canada to purchase
              a specific item of equipment or software from a specific source
              on behalf of Canada. In this case, the Offeror must ensure that
              its subcontract for the equipment or software states that &quot;If
              a third party claims that equipment or software that the subcontractor
              supplies under the Standing Offer infringes any intellectual right,
              the subcontractor, if requested to do so by either the Offeror
              or Canada, will defend the Offeror and Canada against that claim
              at the subcontractor's expense and will pay all costs, damages
              and legal fees that a court finally awards.&quot; In the event
              that the Offeror is unable to incorporate this into its subcontract,
              then it will advise Canada of the situation and not proceed with
              the subcontract without receiving written notice from Canada that
              the level of intellectual property right infringement protection
              is acceptable.</p>
            <p>(4) Without prejudice to Canada's right to terminate the Standing
              Offer for default prior to completion of the work, the above represents
              the Offeror's entire obligation to Canada regarding any claim of
              infringement.</p>
            <p>(5) The Offeror has no obligation regarding any claim based on
              any of the following:</p>
            <p>a) Canada's unauthorized modification of the equipment or software,
              or Canada's unauthorized use of the equipment or software in other
              than its specified operating environment;</p>
            <p>b) the combination, operation or use of the equipment or software
              with any product, data or apparatus that the Offeror did not provide
              under the Standing Offer, or which combination, operation or use
              the Offeror did not authorize or approve in advance, if infringement
              would not have occurred but for such combination, operation or
              use.</p>
            <p> 2.3.2 Limitation of Liability</p>
            <p> 1. Liability of Canada and the Contractor to Third Parties:</p>
            <p>Each Party to this Contract agrees it is responsible to any third
              party for injury or losses that the third party may suffer to the
              extent such Party to this Contract caused them, where the third
              party has a cause of action directly against that Party in respect
              of the injury or losses. The Parties agree that with respect to
              such third party claims against the Contractor, the Contractor
              will be responsible for damages arising out of the injury or losses
              to the extent that it caused them, including those situations where
              Canada may be required to pay the damages caused by the Contractor
              as a result of joint and several liability. With respect to third
              party claims where the third party does not have a cause of action
              directly against the Party causing the damage, this Section does
              not prevent or restrict in any way Canada's right to pursue and
              enforce any rights that it may have against the Contractor. In
              the event of any conflict between this Section (1) and any other
              Section of this Article, this Section (1) will prevail.</p>
            <p>2. Extent of Contractor's Liability for Damages: Regardless of
              the basis on which Canada may be entitled to claim damages from
              the Contractor (whether in contract, tort or any other cause of
              action), the Contractor is liable to Canada only for the following:</p>
            <p>(a) all damages and costs resulting from intellectual property
              right infringement as set out in Article 2.3.1(1);</p>
            <p>(b) all damages for physical injury, including death, caused by
              the Contractor, its employees, agents or subcontractors;</p>
            <p>(c) all direct damages for loss of or physical harm to tangible
              property and real property caused by the Contractor, its employees,
              agents or subcontractors;</p>
            <p>(d) all damages for breach of confidentiality;</p>
            <p>(e) all damages arising from claims for liens, attachments, charges
              or other encumbrances or claims upon or in respect of any materials,
              parts, work-in-process or finished work furnished to, or in respect
              of which any payment has been made by, Canada, provided that this
              Subsection does not apply to claims of intellectual property infringement
              which claims are covered in Subsection (a) above; and,</p>
            <p>(f) any other direct damages caused by the Contractor, its employees,
              agents or subcontractors in relation to this Contract, including
              re-procurement costs as defined below, and restoration of records
              to the extent that the Contractor fails to comply with Section
              4 below, up to an aggregate maximum for this Subsection 2 (f) of
              $1,000,000.<br>
                <br>
                3. The Contractor will not be liable to Canada for the following:</p>
            <p>(a) damages of third parties claimed against Canada except those
              referred to in Subsections 2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above;</p>
            <p>(b) harm to Canada's records or data, except for the restoration
              set out in Section 4 below, and subject to the limitation set out
              in Subsection 2(f) above; or</p>
            <p>(c) special, indirect or consequential damages (other than the
              payments referred to in Subsection 2(a) above, and the damages
              referred to in Subsection 2(b) above), even if the Contractor is
              made aware of the potential for such damages, including lost profits
              and lost savings.</p>
            <p>Canada is responsible for maintaining adequate backup of its records
              and data to enable their restoration if needed for any reason.
              If Canada's records or data are harmed by the Contractor's or a
              subcontractor's negligence or willful act, the Contractor is responsible
              for restoring Canada's records and data to the same state as in
              the last available backup copy. For the purposes of this Article:</p>
            <p>(a) total estimated cost will mean the dollar amount shown on
              the first page of the Contract in the cell titled &quot;Total Estimated
              Cost&quot;;</p>
            <p>(b) re-procurement costs will mean all identifiable direct costs
              incurred by Canada to re-procure the Work with another contractor,
              including de-installation and return of the Work to the Contractor,
              administrative costs of selecting another contractor or re-tendering
              all or part of the Contract, as applicable, and any increase in
              the price payable by Canada for the other Work having equivalent
              functionality, performance and quality; and,</p>
            <p>(c) the term &quot;Contract&quot; will apply to stand-alone contracts,
              and to each call-up, purchase order and other contractual document,
              irrespective of its title, issued under a Standing Offer or a Supply
              Arrangement.</p>
            <p>Modification #2</p>
            <p>The following article (2.3.3) is inserted at the end of Section
              26, Clause 2 of PWGSC-TPSGC 9601 (Default by the Contractor):</p>
            <p>2.3.3 Notwithstanding the above the Minister will not terminate
              the Contract in a bankruptcy/insolvency situation unless the Contractor
              is also in material breach of the Contract.<br>
