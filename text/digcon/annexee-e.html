            <p><a name="e10"></a>E 1.0 EQUIPMENT SUBSTITUTIONS<br>
  Equipment substitutions or delivery of equipment other than specified in the
    Standing Offer will not be accepted and may result in the withdrawal of authority
    from the Identified Users to utilize the Standing Offer as detailed in Part
    6 A 12.2.</p>
            <p>E 1.1 Substitution of Internal Components<br>
              If the Offeror wishes to substitute internal components of an existing
                NMSO product, the substitution must have completed any required
                benchmark testing and be approved by the Standing Offer Authority
                prior to acceptance of Call-ups for that equipment and delivery
                to any Identified User.</p>
            <p>E 1.2 Substitution of Products<br>
              In the event that the Offeror wishes to propose a substitution
                for an existing NMSO product, Active or Inactive, the Offeror
                must submit a Request for Substitution, as detailed in Annex
                E 2.0 below to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority. The Offeror
                agrees and understands that the proposed substitution must be
                a new product that was not available for offer or testing on
                the closing date of the initial RFSO, that the photocopier/MFD
                must meet or exceed the base specification(s) of the sub-category
                into which it is being substituted and that it must have an equal
                or lower ratio of dollar of cost per Benchmark point than the
                product being substituted for.</p>
            <p>A photocopier/MFD submitted as a substitution may only be submitted
              into a sub-category where the Offeror already has a currently offered
              photocopier/MFD. If the substitution is successful and the new
              product is accepted, the subbed-out photocopier/MFD will be removed.</p>
            <p>The proposed substitution will be subject to benchmark evaluation
              and all applicable costs (e.g. transportation, benchmark fee, etc.)
              will be at the Offeror's expense. Offerors who are substituting
              their products on the NMSO must comply with the testing guidelines
              outlined in Annex J.</p>
            <p>In the event of product substitution, the firm Fixed Monthly Rate
              and the firm CPC Rate of any accepted product will become the new
              ceiling rates.</p>
            <p>The Offeror agrees and understands that Canada reserves the right
              to accept or reject any proposed substitutions. The Offeror agrees
              that no substitute items will be shipped until formally authorized
              by PWGSC in writing.</p>
            <p>E 1.3 Interim Benchmark Testing Time Frames<br>
              Interim benchmark testing will be performed on demand. NSTL will
                accept photocopiers/MFDs for testing at the request of the Standing
                Offer Authority with a minimum of 15 calendar days notice. NSTL
                will complete the tests and provide spreadsheet results to PWGSC
                within 20 calendar days. PWGSC will advise NSTL of the acceptance
                or rejection of the product as a substitution and will post the
                new pricing information of accepted products on the next Product
                and Pricing Refresh Date. NSTL will revise the Benchmark Report
                data for the NSTL/IPMG web site and post it on the next Product
                and Pricing Refresh Date after notification of acceptance.</p>
            <p>E 1.4 Addition of New Photocopiers/MFDs - NOT PERMITTED<br>
  Offerors are not permitted to increase the total number of new photocopiers/MFDs
    on their NMSO. New products may only be introduced to the NMSO via substutition
    of an existing product with the new product being proposed for the same sub-category
    as the product that is being removed. The addition of renewal products is
    permitted.</p>
            <p><a name="e20"></a>E 2.0 INITIATING THE SUBSTITUTION</p>
            <p>E 2.1 Notification of Request for Substitution<br>
              To initiate the substitution procedure, the Authorized Representative
                of the Offeror must submit by e-mail or paper copy, a Request

            <p>E 3.4 NSTL/Vendor Agreement<br>
              One executed Agreement will have been submitted by the Offeror
                at the time of the initial benchmark testing. This document constitutes
                a legal agreement between the Offeror and NSTL. Interim bench
                testing will not require another agreement unless there are changes.</p>
            <p>E 3.5 Benchmark Fees <br>
              All costs associated with the benchmark testing will be at the
                Offeror's expense. A certified cheque in the amount required

                than one photocopier/MFD may present one cheque for all photocopiers/MFDs
                or one cheque for each group of photocopiers/MFDs submitted for
                testing. Photocopiers/MFDs that are not paid for within 24 hours
                of setup will be removed from the benchmark without being tested.</p>
            <p>E 3.6 Previous Test Data</p>
            <p>E 3.6.1 If a photocopier/MFD offered under this RFSO has previously
              been tested by NSTL for other requirements, any applicable test
              data may be used. The applicability of data from previous testing
              will be determined by NSTL. Decisions by NSTL will be final in
              this respect. </p>
            <p>E 3.6.2 An administration fee will be required to cover the costs
              of recompiling and posting the data for the new requirement. At
              no time will the fee be in excess of the benchmark test fee identified
              for the photocopier/MFD in Annex P.<br>

              exceed the specifications of the base configurations specified
              in the original RFSO and must be identical to the equipment specified
              in Annex C of the Offer unless a formal change is requested to
              provide a configuration of the model offered that exceeds the specifications
              of the offered model. The unit tested must be identical to the
              unit priced in Annex D of the Offer unless a formal change is requested
              to provide a configuration of the model offered that exceeds the
              specifications of the offered model at the same rates. No substitutes
              will be accepted unless approved by PWGSC prior to commencement
              of the benchmark testing.</p>
            <p>E 4.5. Equipment Set Up<br>
              It is the Offeror's responsibility to install, set up and test
                the equipment at the site prior to the benchmark testing. Moreover,
                the following conditions must be respected by any Offeror:</p>
            <p>E 4.5.1 The Offeror will not be permitted more than 3.0 hours
              to set up each machine. </p>
            <p>E 4.5.2 Offerors setting up more than 1 machine are expected to

              guidelines: <br>
  4 hours for up to 8 machines<br>
  8 hours for up to 16 machines <br>
  12 hours for over 16 machines</p>
            <p>E 4.5.3 NSTL reserves the right to limit setup time beyond these
              guidelines.</p>
            <p>E 4.5.4 It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that equipment
              is delivered to the Benchmark test site on the appointed date,
              more than three (3) hours prior to 5:00 pm EST, at which time the
              Benchmark test site closes.</p>
            <p>E 4.6 Fault Situations</p>
            <p>E 4.6.1 If the Offeror is not able to make equipment function
              properly or is found to be different from the photocopier/MFD described
              in Annex &quot;C&quot;, it must be removed, and a new appointment
              must be made at that time to deliver an operational and/or compliant
              photocopier/MFD within 2 working days. </p>
            <p>E 4.6.2 If the equipment delivered exceeds the specifications
              of the photocopier/MFD described in Annex &quot;C&quot; and/or
              Annex &quot;D&quot;, the Offeror must reconfigure the equipment
              to meet the description of the equipment offered or apply for a
              formal change to supply the configuration tested at the rates given
              in Annex &quot;D&quot;. The Offeror must also provide an updated
              Annex &quot;C&quot; to NSTL with the revised specifications of
              the product.</p>
            <p>E 4.6.3 If the Offeror is not able to deliver a properly operational
              photocopier/MFD by the time set for the second appointment, or
              the photocopier/MFD does not operate properly when delivered and
              set up, or the equipment that was delivered does not meet or exceed
