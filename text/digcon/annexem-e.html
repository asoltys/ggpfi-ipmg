            EVALUATION AND BASIS OF SELECTION</p>
            <p>M 1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
            <p>Offerors must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the PWGSC Standing
              Offer Authority that they meet the criteria as set out in this
              solicitation. Offerors may be required to provide, prior to award
              of Standing Offer, specific information with respect to their legal
              and financial status, and their technical capability to satisfy
              the requirements as stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
            <p>Rates will be firm ceiling rates in Canadian dollars with Canadian
              Customs Duties and Excise Taxes as applicable included and Goods
              and Services Tax (GST)/Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) excluded. Where
              purchase prices are supplied for Additional Equipment, they will
              be firm ceiling prices.</p>
            <p>The Employment Equity provisions referenced herein apply to Canadian
              suppliers only.</p>
            <p>M 1.1 Mandatory Requirements<br>
              Statements contained in this document and its annexes which incorporate
                the words &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;must&quot; or &quot;will&quot; are
                to be interpreted as mandatory. At the time of Standing Offer
                issue, an Offer must not deviate from any mandatory item and
                all mandatory documentation must have been furnished.</p>
            <p>M 1.2 Point Rated Requirements<br>
  Certain aspects of this requirement will be point rated. These point rated
    requirements will be clearly identified and used in the evaluation of the
    NMSO.</p>
            <p>M 1.3 Evaluation Team<br>
              Following the bid solicitation closing date, a committee composed
                of representatives of Public Works and Government Services Canada
                will evaluate the Offers. The evaluation will commence following
                the solicitation closing date and will continue until such time
                as the evaluation team has completed their assessment of all
                offers submitted. Offerors will not be given any information
                regarding the status of their offer until such time as the evaluation
                of all offers has been completed.</p>
            <p>The Evaluation Team reserves the right to:</p>
            <p>(a) reject any and all Offers submitted in response to this RFSO;</p>
            <p>(b) authorize any Offers in whole or in part without negotiation.</p>
            <p>All or any portion of this RFSO and the successful Offer(s) may
              be incorporated into any Standing Offer(s).</p>
            <p>Offers submitted in response to this RFSO will be evaluated as
              detailed below; Canada reserves the right to interview key personnel
              and/or obtain presentations concerning the Offeror's offer at no
              cost to Canada.</p>
            <p>M 1.4 Clarification<br>
              An Offer may be considered non-responsive if it is not supported
                by proper and adequate detail, particularly where supporting
                evidence is required by a Mandatory item.</p>
            <p> Canada will notify Offerors in writing of any supporting information
              noticed missing from their Offer after a preliminary review of
              all Offers. Offerors will be allowed 48 hours (weekends and holidays
              excluded) from time of notification by the PWGSC Standing Offer
              Authority to provide the missing information. The Offer will be
              considered non-responsive if the required information is not provided
              within this 48 hour period.<br>
            </p>
            <p>M 1.4.1 Individual to Clarify Offer<br>
            &quot;We agree that it is imperative that the individual in our firm
            who is authorized to clarify our offer be available during that period,
            if required&quot;. It will be solely the responsibility of the Offeror
            to ensure the availability of this person.</p>
            <p>NAME OF INDIVIDUAL AUTHORIZED TO CLARIFY STANDING OFFER:</p>
            <p>Name Tel # <br>
              E-mail Fax # </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>M 1.5 It is understood and accepted by the Offeror that all decisions
              on whether an offer meets (or to what degree it meets) the stated
              requirements are the sole judgment of the evaluation team.</p>
            <p>After Bid Closing, Canada's interpretation of Contractual issues,
              technical specifications, and any clarifications will prevail. </p>
            <p>M 1.6 Negotiations may follow prior to award of any resulting
              Standing Offer(s) to the successful Offeror(s). </p>
            <p>M 2.0 THE STRUCTURE OF THE EVALUATION<br>
              All Offers submitted will be evaluated in the following manner:</p>
            <p>M 2.1 Preliminary Evaluation<br>
              Because of the complexity of this requirement, the Evaluation Team
                will conduct a preliminary review of all Offers to assure that
                all supporting information and documentation has been provided.</p>
            <p>Canada will treat all Offerors equally but it cannot guarantee
              that its preliminary review will reveal all deficiencies and cannot
              be held responsible or liable if it's preliminary review fails
              to detect a deficiency. It is possible that a missed mandatory
              may be overlooked and the Offer will be subsequently determined
              (i.e. after the period allowed for correction) by Canada to be
              non-responsive.</p>
            <p>Offerors will be notified, in writing, of any supporting information
              and/or documentation noticed missing from their Offer. The missing
              information/documentation must be provided within 48 hours (weekends
              and holidays excluded) from close of business on the date of notification
              by the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority. Failure to provide the missing
              information/documentation within the 48 hour period will result
              in the Offer being considered non-responsive and the entire Offer
              will receive no further consideration.</p>
            <p>M 2.2 Evaluation for Compliance <br>
  The Evaluation for Compliance, as detailed in M 3.0 below, will be conducted
    prior to the call to Product Benchmark Testing. </p>
            <p>M 2.3 RFSO Benchmark Testing<br>
              Benchmark Tests as detailed in Annex J - RFSO Benchmark Testing,
                will be conducted prior to the Financial Evaluation, the sole
                exception being as detailed in Annex M 3.0 Evaluation for Compliance.</p>
            <p>During the bid evaluation phase and upon Canada's request, Offerors
              will allow Canada to conduct an evaluation, which may include but
              not be limited to, the Offeror's legal status, facilities, technical,
              financial and managerial capabilities to fulfill the requirements
              stated in this bid solicitation.</p>
            <p>M 2.4 Financial Evaluation<br>
              M 2.4.1 Financial evaluation, as detailed in Annex M 5.0 below,
                will be conducted upon receipt of the benchmark results.</p>
            <p>M 2.4.2 The Financial Proposal will be held in a secure area,
              and will not be evaluated until the benchmark test results are
              received by PWGSC.</p>
            <p> M 2.4.3 The sole exception to this will be when offers are received
              from multiple parties for identical products. In such cases, the
              financial evaluation will determine which Offeror will be invited
              to submit the product for benchmark testing.</p>
            <p>M 3.0 EVALUATION FOR COMPLIANCE</p>
            <p>M 3.1 Overview<br>
              For an Offer to be considered responsive the Offeror must have
                completed all applicable forms and provided all requested documentation
                as detailed in this RFSO. Compliance of each Offer and each offered
                product to mandatory requirements and specifications will be
                verified or confirmed before issue of any resulting Standing
                Offer.</p>
            <p>Offers will be evaluated on the basis of compliance to the identified
              mandatory requirements relating to the their organizational structure
              and experience, their proposed service solution and on their acceptance
              of all mandatory terms and conditions. Offers that are judged to
              not meet these mandatory requirements will be eliminated from further
              consideration. </p>
            <p>All Offers received will be compared separately against the requirements
              of the RFSO and the accompanying technical specifications, and
              not against each other. Offers will be evaluated in terms of the
              criteria detailed in the Proposal Format Instructions above. The
              Evaluation Team will determine the extent to which the Offeror
              meets each evaluation factor.</p>
            <p>The Evaluation Team reserves the right to interview any proposed
              personnel to verify claimed work experience as provided in response
              to the RFSO and/or conduct a survey of its facilities and technical
              abilities.</p>
            <p>In addition to other mandatory requirements detailed herein, the
              Offeror may be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Canada
              that it is financially capable of performing the services pursuant

              to determine they have the competence and capability to deliver
              products services according to the terms and conditions of any

            <p>M 3.3 Evaluation of Lease and Service Proposal<br>
              This proposal will be evaluated in terms of clarity, feasibility
                and completeness in terms of providing a management structure
                and process that will provide a quality service that meets the
                Standing Offer requirements. The evaluation team will examine
                how the Offeror addresses all the required elements and completes
                all the required certifications. It will also include a consideration
                of the relevant experience of key management personnel and confirm
                the required Authorized Agent Certification, if applicable.</p>
            <p>Any required management reports will be evaluated in terms of
              completeness and clarity.</p>

              During the bid evaluation phase and upon Canada's request, Offerors
                will allow Canada to conduct an evaluation, which may include
                but not be limited to, offeror's legal status, facilities, technical,
                financial and managerial capabilities to fulfill the requirements
                stated in this bid solicitation.</p>
            <p>Once it is determined that Offerors meet the mandatory requirements
              of the RFSO and that the photocopiers/MFDs offered by these Offerors
              meet the minimum technical specifications, a list of these products
              will be submitted to NSTL Canada Corp. (NSTL). NSTL, in cooperation
              with the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority, will then draw up the
              Benchmark Test Schedule and PWGSC will notify the Offerors when
              to bring in their products. Additional detail about the test procedure
              and the address of the bench test site will be supplied at this
              time.</p>
            <p>The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation
              but is used rather to generate a score based on the performance
              (speed), quality of output, features and usability of the photocopier/MFD.
              This score is used in the determination of Value for Dollar in
              the Financial Evaluation. The data generated through the benchmark
              testing will be posted on the Digital Connected photocopier/MFD
              Internet site to assist Identified Users in their purchasing decisions.</p>
            <p>Offerors with outstanding compliance issues may request to have
              their product(s) tested but should the issues not be resolved by
              the end of the testing period, the product(s) will be eliminated
              and any Benchmark fees paid are forfeited.</p>
            <p>M 4.2 RFSO Benchmark Test Procedures<br>
              Benchmark Tests as detailed in Annex J - RFSO Benchmark Testing,
                will be conducted prior to the Financial Evaluation, the sole
                exception being as detailed in Annex M 2.4.3.</p>
            <p>M 5.0 FINANCIAL EVALUATION - NEW EQUIPMENT<br>
              Following Benchmark Testing, the Offeror's Financial Offer will
                be evaluated and an Evaluated Cost will be calculated for each
                product successfully tested. This will be calculated from the
                Fixed Monthly Rates and the CPC Rates proposed in Annex C, less
                any reductions for Environmental Programs in place and Security
                of the device.</p>
            <p>ONLY TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT BIDS FOR PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE COMPLETED
              BENCHMARK TESTING WILL BE USED IN THE FINANCIAL EVALUATION</p>
            <p>M 5.1 Detailed Cost Evaluation - New Equipment<br>
              The average estimated cost for each new monochrome photocopier/MFD,
                as detailed in the appropriate Annex D is based on the sum of
                the amounts calculated in Annex M 5.1.1 (Total Monthly Rate Cost)
                and Annex M 5.1.2 (Total CPC Rate Cost) to produce the Base Evaluated
                Cost.</p>
            <p>For colour photocopier/MFD sub-categories only, the Base Evaluated
              Cost is calculated in Annex M 5.1.3 using two CPC Rates.</p>
            <p>The Base Evaluated Cost for both monochrome and colour photocopiers/MFDs
              is then decreased by the reduction for Environmental Programs in
              place and for the Security Level of the photocopier/MFD (up to
              a total of 5% as per Annex K 5.3.2 and K 5.4), if applicable, to
              create the Total Evaluated Cost.</p>
            <p>M 5.1.1 Calculation of the Total Monthly Rate Cost:<br>
              - the applicable Base FMR associated with a 24 Month Commitment
                Period multiplied by 24, plus<br>
              - the applicable Base FMR associated with a 36 Month Commitment
              Period multiplied by 36, plus<br>
              - the applicable Base FMR associated with a 48 Month Commitment
              Period multiplied by 48, plus<br>
              - the applicable Base FMR associated with a 60 Month Commitment
              Period multiplied by 60.</p>
            <p>- The sum of which will be divided by 4.</p>
            <p>M 5.1.2 Calculation of the Total CPC Rate Cost - Monochrome photocopiers/MFDs
              (Categories A to C)</p>
            <p>- the CPC Rate multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage, as
              specified herein, multiplied by 24, plus<br>
              - the CPC Rate multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage, as specified
              herein, multiplied by 36, plus<br>
              - the CPC Rate multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage, as specified
              herein, multiplied by 48, plus<br>
              - the CPC Rate multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage, as specified
              herein, multiplied by 60.<br>
              <br>
              - The sum of which will be divided by 4.</p>
            <p>M 5.1.3 Calculation of the Total CPC Rate Cost - Colour photocopiers/MFDs
              (Categories D and E)</p>
            <p>The CPC Rate calculation for Colour photocopier/MFD will be as
              follows:</p>
            <p>- The total of the applicable CPC Rate for colour pages for a
              24 month Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly
              Usage for colour pages, as specified herein multiplied by 24, plus
              the applicable CPC Rate for monochrome pages for a 24 month Commitment
              Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage for monochrome
              pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 24; plus</p>
            <p>- the total of the applicable CPC Rate for colour pages for a
              36 month Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly
              Usage for colour pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 36;
              plus the applicable CPC Rate for monochrome pages for a 36 month
              Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage for
              monochrome pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 36; plus<br>
                <br>
                - the total of the applicable CPC Rate for colour pages for a
                48 month Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly
                Usage for colour pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 48;
                plus the applicable CPC Rate for monochrome pages for a 48 month
                Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage
                for monochrome pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 48;
                plus</p>
            <p>- the total of the applicable CPC Rate for colour pages for a
              60 month Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly
              Usage for colour pages, as specified herein, multiplied by 60;
              plus the applicable CPC Rate for monochrome pages for a 60 month
              Commitment Period multiplied by the applicable Monthly Usage for
              monochrome pages, as specified herein multiplied by 60;<br>

            <p>M 5.2 Product Selection - New Equipment</p>
            <p> Once the Total Evaluated Cost for each photocopier/MFD submitted
              as New Equipment is calculated and the Total Weighted Points for
              each photocopier/MFD have been received from the testing authority,
              a dollar of costs per benchmark point Value Factor is calculated
              by dividing the Total Evaluated Cost by the Total Overall Score
              achieved in the benchmark tests.</p>
            <p>M 5.2.1 Category A - Aggregated</p>
            <p>Products from the same Offeror in the sub-categories of Category
              A will be selected on an aggregate basis.</p>
            <p>The Value Factor of each product of Category A will be weighted
              as follows:<br>
              Sub-category A1: 35%<br>
              Sub-category A2: 20%<br>
              Sub-category A3: 45%</p>
            <p>The weighted Value Factors will be added together to arrive at
              the Aggregate Value Factor for<br>
              Category A.</p>
            <p>Standing Offers will be put in place for Offerors having photocopiers/MFDs
              with an Aggregate Value Factor of no more than 50% higher than
              the Offeror with the lowest Value Factor in Category A. An Offeror
              will either receive a Standing Offer for all sub-categories of
              Category A, or none at all. Standing Offers will not be put in
              place for less than all three sub-categories of Category A.</p>
            <p>M 5.2.2 Categories B through E - Sub-categories Evaluated Separately</p>
            <p>For Categories B through E, the sub-categories will be evaluated
              separately. Standing Offers will be put in place for Offerors having
              a photocopier/MFD with a Value Factor of no more than 50% higher
              than the photocopier/MFD with the lowest Value Factor that sub-category.</p>
            <p>The photocopier/MFD in each sub-category offering the lowest dollars
              of cost per benchmark point Value Factor will be highlighted as
              offering the Best Value to Canada in the NMSO configuration.</p>
            <p>For sub-categories with only one product offered, selection will
              be made by the Evaluation Committee on the basis of price support
              proving Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p> Only the lowest priced identical photocopier/MFD models offered
              will be evaluated and accepted.</p>
            <p>M 5.2.3 Active and Inactive Products</p>
            <p>During evaluation of the initial Offers prior to NMSO issuance
              and during each subsequent Product and Pricing Refresh, a product
              that achieves a Value Factor of no more than 20% higher than the
              product with the lowest Value Factor in any given sub-category
              will be listed as an Active Product on the Offeror's NMSO. If at
              any point in time during the period of the NMSO a product's Value
              Factor falls outside of this 20% range, the product will then be
              listed as an Inactive Product.</p>
            <p>For Category A, the Aggregate Value Factor will be used.</p>
            <p>M 5.2.4 Product and Pricing Refresh</p>
            <p>A refresh of the products and pricing on the NMSO will be performed
              by PWGSC approximately every two months after NMSO issuance. A
              schedule of the Refresh Dates will form part of the Standing Offer
              Agreement.</p>
            <p>In cases of pricing changes of New products, all necessary edits
              must be submitted on the IPMG/NSTL website no later than three
              business days prior to the Refresh Date.</p>
            <p>In cases of substitution of new products, all necessary supporting
              documentation must be submitted to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority
              no later than five business days prior to the Refresh Date. Benchmark
              testing must also have been completed and scores must be forwarded
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority no later than five business
              days prior to the Refresh Date.</p>
            <p>Changes to the NMSO regarding Renewal equipment may be submitted
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority at anytime.</p>
            <p>A product will not automatically be eliminated (without the possiblity
              of return) after issuance of the NMSO if it exceeds the 50% threshold.
              However, the elimination of the product will apply to those exceeding
              the 50% threshold for more than one refresh period after they exceed
              the threshold. </p>
            <p>In other words, the product will be eliminated if its value factor
              does not return to within the 50% threshold at the next refresh
              date.</p>
            <p>M 6.0 FINANCIAL EVALUATION - RENEWAL EQUIPMENT</p>
            <p>M 6.1 Detailed Cost Evaluation - Renewal Equipment</p>
            <p>(a) Renewal Fixed Monthly Rate (FMR)</p>
            <p>The FMR for first renewals must be submitted as a percentage of
              the original FMR that the Identified User is paying, not exceeding
              80% of the original FMR.</p>
            <p>The FMR for second renewals must be submitted as a percentage
              of the first renewal FMR that the Identified User is paying, not
              exceeding 80% of the first renewal FMR.</p>
            <p>Fixed Monthly Renewal Rates for each of the three Renewal Commitment
              Periods (12, 24 and 36 months) must be submitted for each item
              for which rates were submitted in previous NMSOs for Digital Connected
              photocopiers/MFDs. </p>
            <p>These rates will be firm ceiling rates during the applicable Renewal
              Commitment Period for the applicable equipment and downward revisions
              only will be accepted. Rate reductions may be submitted to the
              PWGSC Standing Offer Authority for publication on the IPMG site.</p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on any renewal
              FMR and to reject any renewal FMR that does not meet the criteria
              of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>If an acceptable rate cannot be negotiated between the Offeror
              and Canada, renewal pricing will not be listed for the photocopier/MFD.<br>
            </p>
            <p>(b) Renewal CPC Rates</p>
            <p>The CPC rates for first renewals must be submitted as a percentage
              of the original CPC rates that the Identified User is paying, not
              exceeding 125% of the original CPC rates.</p>
            <p>The CPC rates for second renewals must be submitted as a percentage
              of the first renewal CPC rates that the Identified User is paying,
              not exceeding 125% of the first renewal CPC rates.</p>
            <p>The CPC Rate is defined as the cost per printed or copied page
              and is fixed for the NMSO Base Configuration for a connected photocopier/MFD
              for each of the three Renewal Commitment Periods (12, 24 and 36
              months) where such rates will be firm ceiling rates during the
              applicable Commitment Period for the applicable equipment. Only
              downward revisions will be accepted. Rate reductions may be submitted
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority for publication on the IPMG
              site.</p>
            <p>The total of the two above rates (FMR and CPC rate) will be for
              the continued provision of the photocopier/MFD including all preventive
              and remedial maintenance services (parts and labour) as required
              in Annex B, removal costs at the end of the lease, and the provision
              of all required reports.</p>
            <p>For renewal colour photocopiers/MFDs, Offerors must quote two
              CPC Rates, one for full colour impressions and one for monochrome
              impressions. </p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on any renewal
              CPC rate and to reject any renewal CPC rate that does not meet
              the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>If an acceptable rate cannot be negotiated between the Offeror
              and Canada, renewal pricing will not be listed for the photocopier/MFD.<br>
            </p>
            <p>(c) Imaging Consumables Pricing</p>
            <p>For monochrome categories only, the cost of all imaging consumables
              (toner and developer, if applicable) must be included as part of
              the CPC Rates. </p>
            <p>For colour categories, wherever the original NMSO rates for the
              photocopier/MFD were quoted toner-out, the cost of toners should
              not be included as part of the CPC Rates, although the cost of
              all other imaging consumables must be incorporated into the rates. </p>
            <p>Where the cost of colour toners was not included as part of the
              CPC rate of an existing photocopier/MFD, pricing for colour toners
              must be submitted as a percentage of the colour toner price from
              the last NMSO on which the photocopier/MFD existed, not exceeding
              125% of this price. Where the cost of colour toners was included
              as part of the CPC rate of an existing photocopier/MFD, the Offeror
              must submit &quot;included in CPC&quot; for the colour toner pricing.</p>
            <p>The price for colour toner on any call-up must either be the price
              as calculated based on the percentage above or the most current
              list price of that toner less any government discount, whichever
              is lower.</p>
            <p>These toner prices will be firm ceiling prices during the applicable
              Renewal Commitment Period for the applicable equipment and downward
              revisions only will be accepted. Price reductions may be submitted
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority for publication on the IPMG
              site.</p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on any imaging
              consumables pricing and to negotiate any imaging consumables pricing
              that does not meet the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>M 6.2 Product Selection - Renewal Equipment</p>
            <p>A renewal product will be listed if it meets the conditions given
              in Annex M 6.1.</p>
            <p>The Evaluation Team will determine which Offers meet the criteria
              of Good Value to Canada and their decisions will be final in this
              respect.</p>
            <p>Renewal rates will be posted for all products meeting the approval
              of the Evaluation Team.</p>
            <p>M 7.0 STANDING OFFER AWARD RECOMMENDATION<br>
  Standing Offers will be put in place for all Offerors with photocopiers/MFDs
    meeting the above criteria of product selection. Final Standing Offer(s)
    approval will be subject to government policies and procedures.<br>
