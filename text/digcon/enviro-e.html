            <p><b>National Master Standing Offer&nbsp; <br>
            </b><b>EZ107-070001/001/VAN to EZ107-070001/011/VAN<br>
FOR THE LEASE OF PHOTOCOPIERS AND MULTIFUNCTION DEVICES (MFDs)</b><strong></strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A 4.7 Environmental Programs in Place</p>
            <p> A 4.7.1 The following Environmental Programs are mandatory:</p>
            <p>a) ISO 14001 Certification<br>
  The Offeror (or its Original Equipment Manufacturer) must be registered under
    ISO 14001 from a nationally accredited registrar under the ISO 14001 Program
    for the manufacturing facility where the specific photocopiers/MFDs being
    offered as part of this Standing Offer are manufactured.</p>
            <p>b) Consumables Container Recycling Program<br>
  The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing
    consumables container recycling program as per the following:</p>
            <p>For all locations in Canada covered by this NMSO where consumables
              containers cannot be recycled through local "blue-box" recycling
              programs, the Offeror must provide its own consumables recycling
              program by either:</p>
            <p>providing prepaid, postage-return packaging with the consumable
              when it is originally delivered, or available for download from
              the manufacturer's website; OR</p>
            <p>picking up used consumables containers at no charge.</p>
            <p>c) Hardware Take-Back and Recycling Program<br>
  The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing
    Hardware Take-Back and Recycling Program as per the following:</p>
            <p>The Contractor must control electronic waste through the establishment
              of an ongoing hardware take-back and recycling program. </p>
            <p>At the end of any lease, the Contractor must take back any leased
              products supplied under any Call-ups at no charge.</p>
            <p>The Contractor must recycle or dispose of all equipment taken
              back in an environmentally sensitive manner. At a minimum, the
              recycling of equipment should involve material recovery and metals
              recovery processes.&nbsp;Facilities used to process end of life
              electronics must meet all applicable health, safety, environment,
              transport and export regulations. Facilities must possess all required
              permits and appropriate insurance.</p>
            <p>Acceptable processes include manual dismantling and sorting into
              major material categories (non-hazardous materials, electronic
              scrap materials, and hazardous materials) and mechanical processing
              for dismantling and/or material separation, with provision of dust
              collection and operator risk assessments and protection.</p>
            <p>Major Material categories are defined as follows:</p>
            <p>i) Non-Hazardous Materials include ferrous metal, non-ferrous
              metal, other metals (brass, bronze, metal fines), plastics, wood,
              and glass (non-leaded).</p>
            <p>ii) Electronic Scrap Materials include cables and wires, printed
              circuit boards (high, medium and low grade), components, including
              hard drives, chips and other electronic components.</p>
            <p>iii) Hazardous Materials include cathode ray tubes (CRT), CRT
              frit, leaded plasma display glass and other leaded glass, rechargeable
              batteries, non-rechargeable batteries, including alkaline, lead
              acid, and coin cell batteries on circuit boards, mercury bearing
              lamps and switches, components containing polychlorinated biphenyls,
              Ink and toner cartridges.</p>
            <p>Electronic scrap materials and hazardous materials:</p>
            <p>- may not be land filled, exported to non-OECD or non-EU member
              countries, or processed with the use of prison labour.</p>
            <p>- exporting of these materials must be done in compliance to the
              Export and Import of <br>
  Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulation (EIHWHRMR).</p>
            <p>In the event that it is determined by Canada that an Offeror is
              refusing to take back product or not recycling that product in
              accordance with the minimum requirements of the standing offer,
              Canada will arrange to have the subject material recovered and
              disposed off appropriately at the cost of the Offeror. In addition,
              the Offeror will have their standing offer de authorized and will
              be excluded from holding a similar standing offer with Canada for
              a minimum of one year from the date of determination.</p>
            <p>d) Packaging Recycling<br>
  The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing
    packaging recycling program as per the following:</p>
            <p>All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped must
              be recyclable. </p>
            <p>The Offeror must take back all packaging from the Identified User's
              site at the time of product installation.</p>
            <p>The Contractor must reuse, recycle or dispose of all packaging
              materials removed from Products delivered under any Call-up in
              an environmentally sensitive manner.</p>
            <p>e) Energy Star Registration<br>
  The Offeror's product must be Energy Star qualified at the time of product
    acceptance. The vendor must Ship all products with the Energy Star low-power
    feature activated or enabled. This eliminates the need for users to configure
    the power-management feature after delivery and helps to ensure that they
    use the energy-saving feature.</p>
            <p>A 4.7.2 The following Environmental Program is an optional requirement
              for which the Offeror will receive an Evaluation Reduction of 3%
              against the evaluated price as well as mention on the IPMG web
              site.</p>
            <p>(a) Third Party Environmental Performance Labeling (3%)<br>
  The photocopier/MFD must be approved for Environmental Ecolabeling Certification.
    Acceptable programs are those that conform to ISO 14024 : 1999, Environmental
    labels and declarations, Type I environmental labeling and are recognized
    by the Global Ecolabeling Network (GEN)</p>
            <p>If the photocopier/MFD proposed does not have Environmental Ecolabeling
              Certification at time of initial offer but achieves certification
              subsequent to Standing Offer issue, the Offeror may submit a request
              and proof of certification for the additional reduction at any
              pricing refresh period.</p>
