                sub-category for a configured photocopier/MFD and the priced
                configuration must be identical to the NMSO configuration described
                in Annex C - Technical Details including all media input and
                output capacities, all finishing capabilities, and all RAM and
                hard disk capacities.</p>
            <p>The Offeror must quote one inclusive rate per Commitment Period
              for the NMSO Configured Unit with the following exception:</p>
            <p>(b) Break-out/Deconfiguration Equipment<br>
              Where the Identified User will be allowed to deconfigure from the
                NMSO photocopier/MFD Configuration, this Configuration must be
                broken out to indicate the part numbers and pricing for each
                modular component included in the configuration with the sum
                of the broken out components equaling the total NMSO FMR for
                the model quoted. These broken out rates must be identical to
                the rates quoted in the Reconfiguration Equipment section. The
                Offeror is not required to quote Deconfiguration pricing but
                must not supply less than the NMSO photocopier/MFD Configuration
                for any call-up for any resulting Standing Offer unless the prices
                are broken out in their offer.</p>
            <p>(c) Removable Hard Drives for Requirement with Security Concerns<br>

                it outright at the beginning of the lease period, Offerors must
                indicate this in the designated areas of Annex C and Annex D.
                The price of the hard drive including all removal costs must
                be quoted in Annex D, as well as any additional stipulations.</p>
            <p>(d) CPC Rate<br>

                NMSO Base Configuration for a connected photocopier/MFD for all
                four Commitment Periods (24, 36, 48 and 60 months) where such
                rates will be firm ceiling rates for the applicable equipment.</p>
            <p>The total of the two above rates (FMR and CPC Rate) will be for
              the supply and delivery under a lease arrangement of the photocopier/MFD
              in the specified configuration, installation including up to two
              (2) hours of Setup and/or Configuration (where applicable), up

                imaging consumables (including, but not limited to, all toners
                and developers, if applicable) must be included as part of the
                CPC Rates.</p>
            <p>(f) Professional Services Rates<br>
              Defined as the rates for various additional Professional Services
                including Setup and/or Configuration, Systems Integration and
                User Training, rates will be firm ceiling rates for applicable
                services. The quoted rates must include all travel, labour, materials
                and all other related costs for any location, except locations
                covered by CLCAs. A base of up to seven (7) hours of Professional
                Services (as specified in Annex L 2.2 (d) above) must be included
                as part of the base FMR and CPC Rate for each photocopier/MFD
                supplied and any additional Professional Services required must
                be fully justified in the Call-up documentation. These rates
                must be quoted on an hourly basis only. The same rate structure
                must be used for both new and renewal equipment.</p>
            <p>Rates quoted for these professional services do not form part
              of the Evaluated Cost in the evaluation, although Canada reserves
              the right to perform a pricing audit on any professional services
              rates and to reject any professional services rates that do not
              meet the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>L 2.3 Reconfiguration/Additional Equipment Pricing</p>
            <p>(a) Reconfiguration Equipment<br>
              Equipment added to form the NMSO Configuration as per the specifications
                of the sub-category and broken out in the pricing of the NMSO
                Configuration must also be quoted as Reconfiguration Equipment
                to allow Identified Users not calling up the full NMSO configuration
                to reconfigure at a later date. The Fixed Monthly Rates for Reconfiguration
                Equipment must be the same as the FMR as broken out in the NMSO
                Base Configuration but with the addition of a 12 month rate.</p>
            <p>Deconfiguration/reconfiguration Equipment quoted must be available
              for Call-up during the full Acquisition Period of the Standing
              Offer. Professional Services charges may apply for the field reconfiguration
              of any equipment as per Annex L 2.4 below.</p>
            <p>(b) Additional Equipment<br>
              The Offeror may provide pricing for additional equipment, other
                than that required by the specifications, which attaches directly
                to or is used by the photocopier/MFD model offered. The prices
                quoted for these options do not form part of the Evaluated Cost
                in the evaluation, although Canada reserves the right to perform
                a pricing audit on any optional equipment or services and to
                reject any optional equipment that does not meet the criteria
                of Good Value to Canada. </p>
            <p>A reasonable list of options to be offered as part of the resulting
              Standing Offer will be negotiated with the successful Offeror.
              The acceptance of all or any options will be at the discretion
              of the Standing Offer Authority on the basis of value to Canada.
              Only Additional Equipment that has been accepted for the Standing
              Offer may be acquired through the Call-up process so Offerors should
              ensure that all applicable equipment has been proposed and listed.</p>
            <p>The Offeror must quote Fixed Monthly Rates for Reconfiguration
              Equipment and Additional Equipment available for each product for
              each Commitment Period of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months where such
              rates will be firm ceiling rates during the applicable Commitment
              Period for applicable equipment. </p>
            <p>In addition to the Fixed Monthly Rates, the Offeror may also quote
              a firm ceiling purchase price for Reconfiguration or Additional
              Equipment. Where the Offeror can present adequate justification
              (third party software licensing, etc.), Additional Equipment may
              be quoted with purchase prices only. </p>
            <p>For periods other than the stated Commitment Periods, the Offeror
              must negotiate with the Identified User to determine the most advantageous
              rate to Canada. At no time will the rate for the Additional or
              Reconfiguration Equipment exceed the rate of the equipment for
              the nearest full Commitment Period.</p>
            <p>L 2.4 Field Installation of Reconfiguration or Additional Equipment<br>
              When Reconfiguration Equipment is subsequently added back to the
                installed configuration or when Additional Equipment is installed
                subsequent to the initial Call-up, or in rare cases as part of
                the initial Call-up, the Offeror will have the right to specify
                an additional charge of up to one (1) hour of Installation and/or
                Configuration (where applicable) and/or one (1) hour of Systems
                Integration (where applicable) and/or two (2) hours of User Training
                (where applicable), at the rates quoted in the Professional Services
                section.</p>
            <p>The number of hours of Professional Services necessary to field
              upgrade any piece of equipment must be detailed as part of the
              equipment description and must be a one time only cost. Canada
              has the right to audit the number of Professional Services hours
              required for any field upgrade. The acceptance of all or any field
              upgrade costs will be at the discretion of the Standing Offer Authority.</p>
            <p>L 3.0 Purchase Prices for PWGSC Use Only<br>
  In addition to the rates and prices above, the Offeror must provide the purchase
    price for the NMSO photocopier/MFD configuration and for the analogous unconnected
    photocopier-only version, if applicable. This pricing is for PWGSC internal
    cost analysis and will not be disclosed to the public or other vendors, or
    released to Identified Users. </p>

              exceeding 125% of the original CPC rates.</p>
            <p>The CPC rates for second renewals must be submitted as a percentage
              of the first renewal CPC rates that the Identified User is paying,
              not exceeding 125% of the first renewal CPC rates.</p>
            <p>The CPC Rate is defined as the cost per printed or copied page
              and is fixed for the NMSO Base Configuration for a connected photocopier/MFD
              for each of the three Renewal Commitment Periods (12, 24 and 36
              months) where such rates will be firm ceiling rates during the
              applicable Commitment Period for the applicable equipment. Only
              downward revisions will be accepted. Rate reductions may be submitted
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority for publication on the IPMG
              site.</p>
            <p>The total of the two above rates (FMR and CPC rate) will be for
              the continued provision of the photocopier/MFD including all preventive
              and remedial maintenance services (parts and labour) as required
              in Annex B, removal costs at the end of the lease, and the provision
              of all required reports. </p>
            <p>For renewal colour photocopiers/MFDs, Offerors must quote two
              CPC Rates, one for full colour impressions and one for monochrome
              impressions. </p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on any renewal
              CPC rate and to reject any renewal CPC rate that does not meet
              the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>If an acceptable rate cannot be negotiated between the Offeror
              and Canada, renewal pricing will not be listed for the photocopier/MFD.<br>
            </p>
            <p>(c) Imaging Consumables Pricing</p>
            <p>For monochrome categories only, the cost of all imaging consumables
              (toner and developer, if applicable) must be included as part of
              the CPC Rates. </p>
            <p>For colour categories, wherever the original NMSO rates for the
              photocopier/MFD were quoted toner-out, the cost of toners must
              not be included as part of the CPC Rates, although the cost of
              all other imaging consumables must be incorporated into these rates. </p>
            <p>Where the cost of colour toners was not included as part of the
              CPC rate of an existing photocopier/MFD, the cost of colour toners
              must be submitted as a percentage of the colour toner price from
              the last NMSO on which the photocopier/MFD existed, not exceeding
              125% of this price. Where the cost of colour toners was included
              as part of the CPC rate of an existing photocopier/MFD, the Offeror
              must submit &quot;N/A&quot; for the colour toner pricing.</p>
            <p>The price for colour toner on any call-up must either be the price
              as calculated based on the percentage above or the most current
              list price of that toner less any government discount, whichever
              is lower.</p>
            <p>These prices will be firm ceiling prices during the applicable
              Renewal Commitment Period for the applicable equipment and downward
              revisions only will be accepted. Price reductions may be submitted
              to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority for publication on the IPMG
              site.</p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit on any imaging
              consumables pricing and to reject any imaging consumables pricing
              that does not meet the criteria of Good Value to Canada.</p>
            <p>L 4.3 Additional/Reconfiguration Equipment Pricing<br>
              Pricing for additional and reconfiguration equipment called up
                for the first time for configuration of equipment already in
                renewal status will be negotiated with the Offeror. This equipment
                may be called up from this NMSO if it was included on the NMSO
                on which the Photocopier/MFD was last listed. The rates for this
                equipment should not exceed the rates for the equipment on the
                last NMSO on which it was listed.</p>
            <p>Canada reserves the right to perform a pricing audit of any additional
              or reconfiguration equipment.</p>
            <p>The Commitment Period of any Additional/Reconfiguration Equipment
              called up for attachment to already leased equipment must not extend
              beyond the Commitment Period of the equipment to which it is attached.</p>
            <p> L 4.3.1 Price Certification<br>
              The Offeror certifies that the rates quoted are not in excess of
                the lowest price charged anyone else, including its most favoured
                customer, for like quality and quantity of the products/services,
                do not include an element of profit on the sale in excess of
                that normally obtained by the Offeror on the sale of products/services
                of like quality and quantity, and do not include any provision
                for discounts to selling agents.</p>
            <p> L 4.3.2 Discretionary Audit<br>
              The Contractor's certification that the price/rate is not in excess
                of the lowest price/rate charged anyone else, including the Contractor's
                most favoured customer, for like quality and quantity of the
                products/services, is subject to verification by government audit,
                at the Minister's discretion, before or after payment is made
                to the Contractor under the terms and conditions of the Contract.
                If the said audit demonstrates that the certification is in error,
                it is agreed that the Contractor must make repayment to Canada
                in the amount found to be in excess of the lowest price.</p>
            <p>L 5.0 Payment by Credit Card<br>
  The Offeror must indicate on Form 6 whether and which credit cards will be
    accepted.</p>
