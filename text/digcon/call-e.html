              to this Standing Offer that do not exceed the applicable Call-up
              Limitations outlined below. The Offeror acknowledges that any Call-up
              made by an Identified User exceeding the applicable Call-up Limitation
              is not permitted under this Standing Offer and is without authority.</p>
            <p><a name="83"></a>8.3 Call-ups for Photocopiers/MFDs only to be Accepted by Active
              Offerors: The Offeror agrees only to accept Call-ups from Identified
              Users for photocopiers and MFDs in a given sub-category during
              periods in which it has been identified by the Standing Offer Authority
              as an &quot;Active Offeror&quot; for that product in that particular
              Sub-category, unless contacted directly by the Standing Offer Authority.
              Call-ups for Optional items may be accepted by Active and Inactive
              Offerors.</p>
            <p><a name="84"></a>8.4 Call-ups to be directed to Offerors and NMSO Authorized Lease/Sales
              Agents: Call-ups must only be addressed to the Offeror or Authorized
              Lease/Sales Agents of the Offeror. NMSO Authorized Lease/Sales
              Agents are permitted to invoice and receive payment for the lease
              and service of the equipment. Call-ups must not be addressed to

            <p><a name="85"></a>8.5 Contracting Authority: PWGSC will act as the Contracting Authority
              for all Call-ups, including those made directly by Identified Users.</p>
            <p><a name="86"></a>8.6 Division of Requirements: Multiple Call-ups must not be issued

  The Work must be authorized or confirmed by the Identified User(s) using form
    PWGSC-TPSGC 942, &quot;Call-up Against a Standing Offer&quot; or a PWGSC
    initiated Call-up on a separate document.</p>
            <p><a name="88"></a>8.8 Limitation of Call-ups: An Identified User may issue a Call-up
              directly to any Offeror or NMSO Authorized Agent in the applicable
              sub-category, up to the applicable Call-up Limitation specified
              below, in accordance with the following:</p>
            <p>8.8.1 For Call-ups for New Equipment Photocopiers and MFDs (which
              may include, within the Call-up Limitation, Additional and Reconfiguration
              Items):</p>
            <p>(a) Up to $25,000 (Including the total Fixed Monthly Rate (FMR)
              charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges,
              and GST/HST): the Identified User may place the Call-up with the
              Active Offeror whose Product, in the Identified User's view, represents
              the best value; </p>
            <p>(b) From $25,000.01 up to $100,000.00 (Including the total Fixed
              Monthly Rate (FMR) charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print
              (CPC) charges, and GST/HST): the Identified User may place the
              Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product, in the required
              configuration, has a Value Factor within 10% of the best Value
              Factor in the required commitment period, in the given sub-category,
              if the Product meets the technical and compatibility requirements
            of the Identified User;</p>
            <p>(c) From $100,000.01 up to $400,000.00 (Including the total Fixed
              Monthly Rate (FMR) charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print
              (CPC) charges, and GST/HST), the Identified User may place the
              Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product, in the required
              configuration, has a Value Factor within 5% of the best Value Factor
              in the required commitment period, in the given sub-category, if
              the Product meets the technical and compatibility requirements
              of the Identified User; For all Call-ups within this range valued
              above $200,000.00, the Identified User must first request and receive
              written permission from the Standing Offer Authority to proceed
              with the Call-up.</p>
            <p>(d) From $400,000 up to $5,000,000 (Including the total Fixed
              Monthly Rate (FMR) charges, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print
              (CPC) charges, and GST/HST): only the Standing Offer Authority
              may place Call-ups. Requirements from $400,000.00 and up to $5,000,000.00
              may be sent to PWGSC in a funded requisition for processing in
              accordance to the Request for Volume Discount (RVD) procedures
              as detailed in the Annex entitled &quot;Request for Volume Discount
              (RVD) and Special Processing Procedures&quot;. </p>
            <p>The Standing Offer Authority reserves the right to negotiate the
              rates and prices for Call-ups over $400,000 and, where the Standing
              Offer Authority determines that the available prices do not represent
              good value, the Standing Offer Authority may use other methods
              of supply to fulfil the requirement.</p>
            <p>These Call-up limitations apply to the total value of the Call-up,
              including any Additional and Reconfiguration Items listed on this
              Standing Offer that are included in the Call-up.</p>
            <p>RVD procedures may be requested for requirements of less than
              $400,000, for more complex requirements such as those across multiple
              sub-categories, or where there are large quantities of low dollar
              value devices.</p>
            <p>8.8.2 For Call-ups of Photocopiers/MFDs from More than One Sub-category:
              Where the Identified User's requirement is for photocopiers/MFDs
              from more than one sub-category and where the Identified User feels
              that there are administrative advantages in contracting with one
              supplier only for the requirement, the Identified User is encouraged
              to calculate, using the tools on the IPMG/NSTL website, the Best
              Value for the aggregate requirement, using their actual print and
              copy volumes where possible. The Call-up limitations defined in
              8.8.1 above will apply to any such aggregate requirement.</p>
            <p>8.8.3 For Call-ups of Additional and Reconfiguration Items only:
              the Identified User may place Call-ups (valued at up to $25,000,
              GST/HST included) that consist of Additional and Reconfiguration
              Items only from any of the Offerors (both Active and Inactive).
              Any Call-ups of Additional and Reconfiguration Items exceeding
              $25,000 must be issued by the Standing Offer Authority.</p>
            <p>8.8.4 Terms to be Confirmed in Call-up: At the time of the Call-up,
              the Offeror must:</p>
            <p>provide the Identified User with any wiring specifications or
              special environmental conditions required for the Products. Any
              alterations to the site are the responsibility of the Identified
              User; 
  determine the language requirements of the Identified User for the user manuals
  to be delivered with the Products; and 
  determine whether receipt of the user manuals on CD-ROM or downloadable from
  the Internet is acceptable (instead of delivery of hard copies)</p>
            <p>8.8.5 Requirements greather than $25,000 (Including the total
              Fixed Monthly Rate (FMR) cost, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print
              (CPC) charges, and GST/HST) that cannot be satisfied by the Active
              Offeror(s) meeting the conditions of 8.8.1 above for the required
              configuration in the required sub-category: Where the Standing
              Offer Authority agrees that the Active Offeror(s) meeting the conditions
              of 8.8.1 above cannot satisfy an Identified User's requirement
            in a Sub-category because that Offeror:</p>
            <p>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User
              within the Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract
              clauses; 
  does not have a product listed in the Best Value Grid on the IPMG website that
  meets all the legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including
  equipment security needs;  
  has failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement; or 
  has already defaulted on a Call-up issued by the Identified User for the required
  Products; or,  has shown itself incapable of meeting the service requirements for that specific
  Identified User,</p>
            <p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up (or the
              Identified User requests and receives written permission from the
              Standing Offer Authority to place a Call-up) with the next highest
              Active Offeror that can fulfil the needs of the Identified User.</p>
            <p>8.8.6 Requirements that Cannot be Satisfied by Active Offerors:
              Where the Standing Offer Authority determines that the none of
              Active Offerors can satisfy an Identified User's requirement in
              any Sub-category because the Active Offerors:</p>
            <p>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User
              within the Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract
              clauses; 
  do not have a product listed in the Best Value Grid on the IPMG website that
  meets all the legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including
  equipment security needs; 
  have all failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement;  
  have defaulted on Call-ups for the Products currently required by the Identified
  User; or, 
  have shown themselves incapable of meeting the service requirements for that
  specific Identified User,</p>
            <p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up with one
              of the other Offerors in the relevant Sub-category that can satisfy
              these requirements, at the unit price(s) that Offeror offered during
              the most recent downward price revision or the Standing Offer Authority
              may use other sourcing methods to procure the Products. Only the
              Standing Offer Authority can place Call-ups with Offerors other
              than the Active Offerors. The Offeror agrees not to accept any
              Call-ups, except from the Standing Offer Authority, while it is
              not an Active Offeror.</p>
            <p>8.8.7 Authority of Identified Users to Place Direct Call-ups may
              be Withdrawn: The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, provide
              the Offerors with 30 days' written notice that the authority of
              an Identified User to place direct Call-ups has been withdrawn.
              In this case, only the Standing Offer Authority may make Call-ups
              on behalf of that Identified User and the Offeror agrees not to
              fulfil any Call-ups made directly by that Identified User.</p>
            <p>8.8.8 Renewal Equipment: Individual Call-ups made by Identified
              Users for Renewal Equipment pursuant to the Standing Offer must
              not exceed $200,000.00 (including the total Fixed Monthly Rate
              (FMR) cost, the total estimated Cost Per Copy/print (CPC) charges,
              and GST/HST).</p>
            <p>8.8.9 Compatibility Sub-Test<br>
  For any Call-up of five (5) photocopiers/MFDs or more, an Identified User or
    the Standing Offer Authority may specify in the Call-up that the Offeror
    provide a photocopier/MFD in the configuration(s) required for a compatibility
    sub-test, prior to delivery of the products, to determine whether the ordered
    Product(s) will meet the Identified User's compatibility requirements. To
    complete these tests, the Offeror must deliver and set up (at any location
    designated by Canada, as long as it is within a radius of 100 km of any city
    or town with a population of at least 30,000, except CLCA areas, within 3
    working days, up to two (2) of the product(s) for testing. </p>
            <p>The products delivered for testing must:</p>
            <p>a) be configured in accordance with the Identified Users actual
              requirements; <br>
  b) be loaded with all necessary drivers; and <br>
  c) be compatible with the specific hardware, network or software requirements
  identified by the Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority at the time
  notice of testing is given to the Offeror. </p>
            <p>If the testing indicates that some
    upgrades/changes (for example, to the drivers or firmware) are required,
              Canada will work with the Offeror to resolve these issues, provided
              they are reasonable within a reasonable period. If testing demonstrates
              that a Product is not compatible with the Identified User's particular
              environment, the Call-up may be cancelled in its entirety and the
              next highest Active Offeror will be considered, for the purposes
              of the Call-up Limitations, to have the Product with the best Value
              Factor.</p>
            <p>If the test unit provided is new and is to be delivered to the
              end-user's location, and if it is agreed upon with the Identified
              User, the test unit may be considered as the first unit of the
              subsequent delivery. Once compatibility is assured, arrangements
              will be made for delivery of the rest of the order.</p>
