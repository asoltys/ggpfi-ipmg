			<p><strong>Delivery of Products, Inclusions and Warranty Service</strong></p>
			<p><strong>			  B.9 Delivery of Products</strong></p>
			<p>		      1) Compatibility Sub-Test</p>
			<p>		      For any Call-up of ten printers or more, an Authorized User or
			      the Contracting Authority may specify in the Call-up that the
			      Offeror must perform a compatibility sub-test, prior to delivery
			      of the Products, to determine whether the ordered Product(s) will meet
			      the Authorized User's compatibility requirements. To complete these
			      tests, the Contractor must deliver and set up (at any location designated
			      by Canada, as long as it is within a radius of 100 km of any city or
			      town with a population of at least 30,000, except CLCA areas), within
			      3 working days, up to two (2) of the Product(s) for testing. The Products
		      delivered for testing must:</p>
			<p>(A)		      be configured in accordance with the Technical Specifications
		        in Annex A; </p>
			<p>(B)
		      be loaded with all necessary drivers; and </p>
			<p>(C)
		      be compatible with the specific hardware, network or software
		            requirements identified by the Authorized User or the Contracting
	            Authority at the time notice of testing is given to the Offeror. </p>
			<p>		      If the testing indicates that some upgrades/changes (for
		              example, to the drivers or firmware) are required, Canada
			      will work with the Offeror to resolve these issues, provided they are
          reasonable within a reasonable period. If testing demonstrates
		              that a Product is not compatible with the Authorized User's
			      particular environment, the Call-up may be cancelled in its entirety
			      and the next highest Active Offeror will be considered, for the purposes
          of the Call-up Limitations, to have the Product with the best
            Value Factor.</p>
			<p>		      If the test unit provided is new and is to be delivered
              to the end-user's location, and if it is agreed upon with the
          Authorized User, the test unit may be considered as the first
          unit of the subsequent delivery. Once compatibility is assured,
          arrangements will be made for delivery of the rest of the order.</p>
			<p><strong>2) Delivery Terms</strong><br>
			  (a) ___________________ (the <strong>&quot;Contractor&quot;</strong>) agrees
			  to supply, deliver, configure, install (if requested), provide
			  documentation, and provide Warranty Services for the Products listed
			  in the Call-up, to the Authorized User by the Delivery Date, in
			  accordance with the terms and conditions and at the price set out in this
			  Contract. Title to all the Products vests in Her Majesty the Queen
			  in right of Canada.</p>
			<p>(b) 
			  Consumables Pricing during Contract Period: The Contractor agrees
			  to supply additional consumables to the Authorized User upon request
			    throughout the Contract Period at the price set out on the IPMG
			  website at the time of the Call-up or the time of the request, whichever
		    is less.</p>
			<p>(c) 			  Inclusions with Products: The Products must be delivered
			  with the following, all of which are included in the unit price(s)
		    for the Products:</p>
			<p>(i) 
			  all ancillary equipment, such as a power supply, cabinetry and
			  connectors required to enable the Product to satisfy the Technical
			  Specifications in Annex A and the Product Details, and be operable
			  in a standard office environment; however, the Contractor is not
			    required to supply a cable to connect the printer to a computer
		    or network;</p>
			<p>(ii) 
		    the first set of imaging consumables (toner, fuser, drum, etc.);</p>
			<p>(iii)
			  one complete set of the user manuals normally included by the Contractor
			  or the OEM with each printer in the Authorized User's Official
			  Language of choice (or bilingual). If the Offeror fails to provide
			  user manuals in the language of the Authorized User's choice, the
			  Offeror must exchange the user manuals for copies in the other
			  language at no cost to Canada. Manuals may be supplied on CD or
			    be downloadable from a website if either of these options is
		    acceptable to the Authorized User; and</p>
			<p>(iv) 
			  any software required for the printer to function in accordance
			  with the Technical Specifications in Annex A (the &quot;Licensed Software&quot;).
			  The Licensed Software must be the current release and, unless otherwise
			  specified, require no further research or development to meet the Technical
			  Specifications and the Product Details. The Licensed Software must be supported
			  by, and fully compatible with the Product(s) up to the limit of the Product's
			  expansion capability. All printer software must be completely integrated
			  with and fully interfaced to the Product. This Contract grants to Canada
			  the perpetual right (i.e., the license to use the Licensed Software is not
			  a &quot;demo&quot; model and does not expire) to install, copy, deploy and
			  use the Licensed Software with the Product(s) in accordance with the terms
			  of this Contract (which does not include any terms or conditions contained
		    in a shrink-wrap license).</p>
			<p>(d) <strong> Delivery Date:</strong> Unless otherwise specified in the Call-up or the
			  Authorized User has agreed in writing to other arrangements, delivery
			  of all Products must be made within the following period (the &quot;Delivery
		    Date&quot;):</p>
			<p>(i) 
		    15 calendar days for orders of fewer than 20 printers; or</p>
			<p>(ii) 
		    20 calendar days for orders of 20 or more printers. </p>
			<p>			  The Contractor must advise the Authorized User of its best delivery
			  date after receipt of the Call-up (which date must be no later
			  than the Delivery Date). If the required number of Products exceeds
			  or threatens to exceed the Contractor's ability to supply by the
			  Delivery Date, the Contractor must immediately advise the Contracting
			  Authority and the Authorized User. The Contracting Authority will
			  have the option of terminating the Call-up for default, extending
			  the delivery date, or of accepting late delivery. Deliveries received
			  after the Delivery Date will be subject to the discounts described
			  in the Article entitled &quot;Discounts for Late Deliveries and
		    Reimbursement of Reprocurement Costs&quot;.</p>
			<p>(e) 			  Products to be New, Off-the-Shelf, and Current: The Products
			  must be new and unused (however, some parts used in the manufacture
			  of the Product may be refurbished, if they are certified as equal
			  quality to new and unused parts); &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; (composed of
			  standard equipment requiring no further research or development);
			  of current manufacture (still in production by the OEM); and conform
			  to the current issue of the applicable specification and/or part
		    number of the OEM.</p>
			<p>(f) 
			  Packaging, Shipping and Delivery: All deliveries to be made in
			  Canada are FOB Destination. Packaging and shipping must be in accordance
			  with the industry standard for all items in order to ensure their
			  safe arrival at destination. Packing slips must accompany each
			  shipment. The Contractor is responsible for the safe delivery and
			  installation (if required by the Call-up) and for obtaining acceptance
			  of the Products at destination. The cost of delivery, including
			  all transportation, packaging and shipping costs, is included in
			  the unit price(s). Costs associated with replacement of Products
			  damaged in transit to the final destination are the Contractor's
			  responsibility, and the Products will not be considered delivered
			  on the Delivery Date unless the Products are undamaged and ready
		    for acceptance.</p>
			<p>(g) 
			  Configuration Before Delivery: All Products must be configured
			  in accordance with the Technical Specifications in Annex A and
			  the Product Details, unless the Call-up specifically provides otherwise.
			  The Contractor must configure the Products, including installation
			  of internal options such as memory or connectivity cards, as detailed
			  in any Call-up, before shipment of the Product(s) to the destination.
		    The configuration of the Products is included in the unit price.</p>
			<p>(h) 
			  Installation upon Request: On-site installation must be available
			  for all Products to be delivered within a radius of 100 km of any
			  city or town with a population of at least 30,000 (except CLCA
			  areas). The Contractor must install the Products if installation
			  is requested in the Call-up. On-site installation includes Product
			  set-up at the installation site and ensuring that the Products
			  are functioning in accordance with the Technical Specifications
			  and the Product Details. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining
			  all work areas at the installation site(s) in a clean and tidy
			  condition on completion of each day of work and on completion of
			  acceptance, including the removal and disposal of all related packing
			  material in accordance with industry standards and the Environmental
			  Requirements set out in Annex B. The installation of the Product
			  is subject to the firm installation price set out in the Best Value
		    Grid on the date of the Call-up.</p>
			<p>(i)
			  Environmental Requirements: The Contractor agrees to comply with
		    all the Environmental Requirements described in Annex B.</p>
			<p>(j) 
			  Additional User Manuals: The Contractor agrees to supply additional
			  user manuals at the price set out in the Best Value Grid on the
		    date of the Call-up.</p>
			<p>(k) 
			  One-Time Use/Returnable Cartridges: One-Time Use/Returnable cartridges
			  are defined as those prescribing additional terms and conditions
			  or licensing agreements that imply Canada will not be buying the
			  cartridges per se, only the use of them. Any terms and conditions
			  or licensing agreements accompanying or on the cartridge itself
			  will not be acknowledged by Canada or passed on through the Call-up
		    document.</p>
