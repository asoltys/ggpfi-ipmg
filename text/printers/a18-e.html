			<p><strong>A.18 Product Substitutions</strong></p>
			<p>		      (a)<strong>Conditions for Proposing Substitution(s): </strong>The Offeror may
			      propose a substitution for an existing Product, provided the proposed
			      substitute provides equal or better value. A Product provides
		        equal or better value if it</p>
			<p>(i)		      is equal or better than the Value Factor of the Product
			  being replaced; and</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      has equal, or lower, prices than the Product being replaced (in
		        each and every order size tier, not just on average); and</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      meets or exceeds the minimum specifications for the Sub-Category
	          of the Product being replaced.</p>
			<p>(b)
		      <strong>Benchmark Testing: </strong>Benchmark testing for proposed substitutions
	            will be performed as required. NSTL Canada Corp. (NSTL) will
	            test printers at the request of the Contracting Authority with
	            a minimum of 15 calendar days' notice. NSTL will complete the
	            tests and provide spreadsheet results to PWGSC within 20 calendar
	            days. All costs associated with the benchmark evaluation (e.g.,
		        transportation, benchmark fee, etc.) are at the Offeror's expense.</p>
			<p>(c)
		      <strong>Process for Requesting Substitution: </strong>To initiate a substitution,
	              the Offeror must submit the following to the Contracting Authority,
	              in addition to completing the Product Details and Pricing Details
              pages of the IPMG website: </p>
			<p>(i)
		      The name, part number and Sub-Category of the existing Product
              the Offeror wishes to replace with the substitution;</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      The OEM name and the OEM part number for the Product (if the
              Offeror has not previously provided an OEM certification from
              the OEM of the new Product, the Offeror must provide this certification);</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      Technical Documentation:</p>
			<p>(A)		      Advertising and technical literature that substantiates
			  the compliance of the Product with each and every mandatory requirement
              in Annex A for the appropriate Group, Category and Sub-Category
              (including the overall Mandatory General Specifications set
              out in Annex A). Offerors are requested to indicate the page
              and paragraph number where substantiation regarding each of
              the mandatory requirements in Annex A can be found. This technical
              documentation must be provided in both official languages.</p>
			<p>(B)		      Proof that the Product:</p>
			<p>(1)		      is certified as compliant with the Canadian Electrical
			  Code for office printers by an organization approved by the Standards
              Branch of Canada;</p>
			<p>(2)
		      is certified by the manufacturer as complying with the Class
              A or B limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus
              set out in the Interference Causing Equipment Standard (ICES-003)
              of Industry Canada, or US FCC Class B equivalent emission limits
              for digital apparatus as set in the Radio Interference Regulations;</p>
			<p>(3)
		      is qualified under the Energy Star program;</p>
			<p>(4)
		      is manufactured in facilities that are both ISO 9001:2000 and
              ISO 14001 certified; and</p>
			<p>(5)
		      has an Environmental Ecolabeling Certification.</p>
			<p>(iv)		      the proposed unit prices for the substitute Product in
			  all required order size tiers (in each tier, the proposed unit
              prices for the substitute Product must be equal or less than
              the prices proposed for the Product that is being replaced). </p>
			<p>(d)
		      <strong>Scheduling of Benchmark Testing:</strong> If the Contracting Authority
              determines that the Offeror has submitted all the information
              required to initiate a substitution, the Contracting Authority
              will notify the Offeror. The Offeror must then contact NSTL
              regarding the test schedule and to arrange a delivery/set-up
              date and time for the Product. NSTL will also provide or confirm
              access to the Features data site so that the Offeror can complete
              the Features Questionnaire. This questionnaire must be completed
              before the Product is delivered to the test site.</p>
			<p>(e)
		      <strong>Conduct of Testing:</strong> On the prearranged date and time the Offeror
              must deliver and set up the Product in accordance with Annex
              C.</p>
			<p>(f)
		      <strong>Acceptance of Substitution Discretionary: </strong>Whether or not to
              accept or reject a proposed substitution is entirely within
              the discretion of Canada. If Canada does not accept a proposed
              substitution, the original Product will continue to be authorized
              under this Standing Offer, unless the Offeror withdraws that
              Product from the Standing Offer; the Offeror acknowledges that
              withdrawal of any Product from a Group 1 Sub-Category may result
              in complete withdrawal from Group 1. The Offeror agrees that
              no substitute items may be shipped under a Call-up until formally
              authorized by PWGSC in writing and posted in the Best Value Grid
              on the IPMG website.</p>
			<p>(g)
		      <strong>Documentation of Accepted Substitution: </strong>If a substitute Product
              is approved for supply under this Standing Offer, it will be
              listed in the Best Value Grid and will be available for purchase
              on Call-ups. Approved substitutions cannot be supplied under
              a Call-up until posted in the Best Value Grid. In the case
              of a Call-up, the substitution must be posted at the time the
              Call-up is issued; otherwise, the item posted in the Best Value
              Grid at the time the Call-up was issued must be supplied. </p>
