  <h3> <a name="gi2" id="gi2"></a>2. Summary</h3>
  <p> This Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) describes Canada's requirements that will lead to the
    establishment of multiple National Master Standing Offers (NMSOs) to supply, deliver, install, and service
    various categories of Desktop and Network Printers, including accessories and supplies on an &quot;as and
    when requested&quot; basis to locations throughout Canada, excluding Comprehensive Land Claims Areas.    </p>
  <p>Resulting NMSOs will be valid for 12 months from the date of issuance (unless Public Works and
    Government Services Canada determines, in its sole discretion, to set aside this procurement vehicle),
    with Canada retaining the right to request up to three (3) extensions of up to six (6) months each.</p>
  <p>It is anticipated that multiple Standing Offers with a total estimated value of $30,000,000.00 may be
    authorized as a result of this Request for Standing Offer. Pricing and technical information about all
    products offered will be distributed publicly on an Internet site where a system of grids will be used to rank
    offers in each category in accordance with the total evaluated cost for each product, enabling judicious
  selection of products best suited to meeting the clients' operational requirements.</p>
  <p>    This RFSO includes categories of equipment that are intended to satisfy the majority of the Government of
    Canada's Desktop and Network Printer needs.</p>
  <p> For Desktop and Network Printer requirements that PWGSC determines cannot be met by any of these
    categories, other purchasing methods will be used. However, the resulting NMSOs are intended to be the
    primary purchasing instrument for Desktop and Network Printers for the Government of Canada.</p>
  <p>    All potential suppliers capable of meeting the requirements of this RFSO are invited to make offers.
    Offerors are not required to be the manufacturer of the products to submit an offer, although the
    manufacturer must certify that non-manufacturer Offerors are authorized to supply and/or service their
    equipment.</p>
  <p> Offers will be evaluated on a Sub-Category basis. Therefore, if an Offeror wishes to submit an offer in only
    one or more specific Sub-Categories, then it has the opportunity to do so. It is not mandatory to make an
    offer or be selected in all categories to be issued a Standing Offer.</p>
  <p> During the Standing Offer Period, Offerors will have the opportunity every month to propose substitute
    products that offer equal or better value to Canada. Canada also reserves the right to add new categories
    during the Standing Offer. All Offerors will also have the opportunity to refresh their prices every month.
    Canada reserves the right to revise this time period if necessary.</p>
  <p> Offerors are encouraged to submit any questions they have regarding the bidding or evaluation process or
    the resulting Standing Offer or Contract clauses to the Standing Offer Authority identified in the solicitation.</p>
  <p>    After any resulting Standing Offers have been issued, all Offerors will be notified in writing regarding the
    outcome of this solicitation.</p>
  <p>    The Identified Users authorized to make call-ups against the Standing Offer include any government
    department, agency or Crown Corporation listed in Schedules I, I.1, II, III, IV and V of the Financial
    Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11.</p>
  <p> The requirement is subject to the provisions of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), the North American
    Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Government
    Procurement (WTO-AGP).</p>
  <p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
  <hr />
  <h3><a name="gi3" id="gi3"></a>3. Security Requirement</h3>
  <p> The security classification of this Standing Offer is &quot;UNCLASSIFIED&quot;. However, the Offeror must treat as
    confidential, during as well as after the provision of goods or services contracted for, any information of a
    character confidential to the affairs of Canada, to which the Offeror's servants or agents become privy. All
    personnel assigned to provide services must have a current security clearance to the level specified in any
    Call-up against this Standing Offer, granted by the Corporate and International Industrial Security
    Directorate.</p>
  <p> Should it become necessary, during the course of the service, for the authorized Department to invoke
    further security measures, the Offeror must comply with the security classification established at that time.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
  <hr />
  <h3><a name="gi4" id="gi4"></a>4. Communications Notification</h3>
  <p> As a courtesy, the Government of Canada requests that successful offerors notify the Standing Offer
    Authority in advance of their intention to make public an announcement related to the issuance of a
    standing offer.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
  <hr />
  <h3><a name="gi5" id="gi5"></a>5. Debriefings</h3>
  <p>After issuance of a standing offer, offerors may request a debriefing on the results of the request for
    standing offers. Offerors should make the request to the Standing Offer Authority within 15 working days
    of receipt of notification that their offer was unsuccessful. The debriefing may be provided in writing, by
  telephone or in person.</p>

  <h2><a name="ep1" id="ep1"></a>PART 4 - EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND BASIS OF SELECTION</h2>
  <h3> 1. Evaluation Procedures</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Offers will be assessed in accordance with the entire requirement of the Request for Standing Offers
      including the technical and financial evaluation criteria.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>  An evaluation team composed of representatives of Canada will evaluate the offers.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>  Because of the complexity of this requirement, the Evaluation Team will conduct a preliminary review
      of all Offers to assure that all supporting information and documentation has been provided. Canada will
      treat all Offerors equally but it cannot guarantee that its preliminary review will reveal all deficiencies and
      cannot be held responsible or liable if it&rsquo;s preliminary review fails to detect a deficiency. It is possible that
      a missed mandatory may be overlooked and the Offer will be subsequently determined i.e. after the
      period allowed for correction) by Canada to be non-responsive.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Offerors will be notified, in writing, of any supporting information and/or documentation noticed
      missing from their Offer. The missing information/documentation must be provided within 48 hours
      (weekends and holidays excluded) from close of business on the date of notification by the PWGSC
      Standing Offer Authority. Failure to provide the missing information/documentation within the 48 hour
      period will result in the Offer being considered non-responsive and the entire Offer will receive no further
      consideration. <br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li><strong>  Technical Evaluation</strong><br />
          <br />
          The Offeror must have been in the printer business for a minimum of the past three (3)
          years and must show competence and capability to deliver products and services
          according to the terms and conditions of any resulting Standing Offer.<br />
          <br />
          If a Product fails to meet the technical minimums as described in Annex A Technical
          Specifications and Annex I Technical Offer, it will be considered non-responsive, and it
          will not be evaluated further.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Financial Evaluation</strong><br />
          <br />
          Responsive offers will be evaluated using the required mandatory financial information as
          described in Annex J Financial Offer and the calculations outlined in Annex H, &ldquo;Definition
          and Calculation of Value Factor&rdquo;.<br />
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
  <hr />
<h3><a name="ep2" id="ep2"></a>2. Basis of Selection</h3>
 <p>Offers will be considered responsive if they meet certain basic corporate requirements and include
   products that meet the requirements of the Technical Offer Annex I and Financial Offer Annex J. </p>
 <p> Products must be bid by sub-category. If more than one Offeror offers the identically-equipped Product in
   the same sub-category, only the lowest priced responsive offer will be listed. Where an Offeror offers the
   identically-equipped Product in multiple sub-categories, then the offered prices must be identical. If the
   prices for the identically-equipped Product in multiple sub-categories are not the identical, then the lowest price will be applied to all categories that the Product is in. The Offeror may offer a maximum of one (1)
   Product per sub-category.</p>
 <p> Standing Offers will be put in place for responsive Offers of a products with a Value Factor no more than
   50% higher than the product with the best Value Factor in that Sub-Category.</p>
 <p> The product in each Sub-Category offering the best Value Factor will be highlighted as offering the Best
   Value to Canada in the NMSO configuration.</p>
 <p> For Sub-Categories with only one product offered, selection will be made by the Evaluation Committee on
   the basis of price support proving good value to Canada.</p>
 <p> Only the lowest priced identical product models offered will be evaluated and accepted.</p>
 <p> PWGSC will identify, for the first one-month period, the Offerors for each Sub-Category having products
   with Value Factors falling within 20% of the best Value Factor on a per Sub-Category basis. These
   Offerors are referred to as the &quot;Active Offerors&quot;, as only their Products will be available to Identified Users
   for Call-ups during the initial one-month period. The new Active and Inactive Offerors and their prices will
   be posted on the Best Value Grid for use on the first business day of the NMSO.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ct1" id="ct1"></a>PART 5 - CERTIFICATIONS</h2>
<p> Offerors must provide the required certifications to be issued a standing offer. Canada will declare an offer
  non-responsive if the required certifications are not completed and submitted as requested.</p>
<p> Compliance with the certifications offerors provide to Canada is subject to verification by Canada during
  the offer evaluation period (before issuance of a standing offer) and after issuance of a standing offer. The
  Standing Offer Authority will have the right to ask for additional information to verify offerors&rsquo; compliance
  with the certifications before issuance of a standing offer. The offer will be declared non-responsive if any
  certification made by the Offeror is untrue, whether made knowingly or unknowingly. Failure to comply with
  the certifications or to comply with the request of the Standing Offer Authority for additional information will
  also render the offer non-responsive.</p>
<h3> 1. Certifications Precedent to Issuance of a Standing Offer</h3>
<p> The certifications listed below should be completed and submitted with the offer, but may be submitted afterwards. If any of these required certifications is not completed and submitted as requested, the
  Standing Offer Authority will so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror with a time frame within which
  to meet the requirement. Failure to comply with the request of the Standing Offer Authority and meet the
  requirements within that time period will render the offer non-responsive.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li> The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) requires that some offerors
    bidding for federal government contracts valued at $200,000 or more (including all applicable
    taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment equity. This is a condition
    precedent to the issuance of a standing offer. If the Offeror is subject to the FCP-EE, evidence of
    its commitment must be provided before the issuance of a standing offer.<br />
    <br />
    Offerors who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human Resources and Social
    Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer eligible to receive government contracts over the
    threshold for solicitation of bids as set out in the Government Contracts Regulations. Offerors may
    be declared ineligible contractors either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSDC, or
    following their voluntary withdrawal from the FCP-EE for a reason other than the reduction of their
    workforce to less than 100 employees. Any offer from ineligible contractors will be declared
  non-responsive.<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li> If the Offeror does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3.(a) or (b) below, or does not
    have a valid certificate number confirming its adherence to the FCP-EE, the Offeror must fax
    (819-953-8768) a copy of the signed form LAB 1168, <a href="http://www1.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/search/eforms/index.cgi?app=profile&amp;form=lab1168&amp;de">Certificate of Commitment to Implement
    Employment Equity</a>, to the Labour Branch of HRSDC.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> The Offeror certifies its status with the FCP-EE, as follows:<br />
    <br />
  The Offeror
    <ol type="a">
      <li>  ( ) is not subject to the FCP-EE, having a workforce of less than 100 permanent full
      time, part-time or temporary employees in Canada,</li>
      <li> ( ) is not subject to the FCP-EE, being a regulated employer under the Employment
      Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c.44;</li>
      <li> ( ) is subject to the requirements of FCP-EE, having a workforce of 100 or more
        permanent full time, part-time or temporary employees in Canada, but has not previously
        obtained a certificate number from HRSDC, (having not bid on requirements of $200,000
        or more), in which case a duly signed certificate of commitment is attached;</li>
      <li> ( ) is subject to FCP-EE, and has a valid certificate number as follows: _______ (e.g.
        has not been declared ineligible contractor by HRSDC).<br />

    certification in the name of the licensee); Acceptable programs are those recognized by the Global
    Ecolabelling Network (GEN). OR<br />
    <br />

  <li>  The Offeror must have a statement from the Offeror that it (or the relevant licensee) is in the
    process of obtaining a Third Party Environmental Ecolabelling certification (recognized by GEN) for each
    Product (or multiple Products). Offerors in this situation will have until the end of the evaluation period to
    submit the certificate(s) for the particular printer(s). This will be approximately 4 weeks after the solicitation
    closing date. The Offeror will be given 3 working days' notification before any pending certificates are due.
    Products for which the Offeror does not produce the required certifications within that time period will be
    declared non-compliant.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1.6 ISO 9001 Certification</strong><br />
    All printers offered must be manufactured in facilities that are ISO 9001 certified.</p>

      <li> <strong>Number of Service Outlets</strong>: The Offeror must also be able to provide the Warranty
        Services described in &ldquo;<strong>Warranty Services</strong>&rdquo; by maintaining, at a minimum:
        <ol type="i">
          <li> Three (3) service outlets in EACH of the Western and Central regions, and</li>
          <li> Two (2) service outlets in EACH of the Pacific, Atlantic and Capital regions.</li>
        </ol>
		The Offeror may satisfy this requirement itself or through its Authorized Agents or
        subcontractors. The Offeror may provide a single toll-free Maintenance Dispatch Number      
        or separate telephone numbers for the service outlets in each region.</li>
      <li> <strong>Sufficiency of Sales and Service Outlets</strong>: The Standing Offer Authority may, at any
        time during the Standing Offer Period, verify that sales and service outlets are available
        (and sufficiently staffed) nationally to make deliveries and provide Warranty Services
        within the time frames set out in &ldquo;<strong>Warranty Services</strong>&rdquo;. Sales outlets are defined as
        providing representation, through either employees, or agents, in the applicable region,
        familiar with the terms and conditions of the National Master Standing Offer as well as
        with the Offeror's pricing and the technical details of the offered products, and able to
        communicate this information to Identified Users. The main deliverable required from a
        Sales outlet is the ability to assist an Identified User, if requested, with the determination
        of their requirement; with the interpretation of product information, and with the placement
        of the subsequent call-up, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Sales
        outlets may be asked to provide pre-sales assistance on-site and this option is to be
        available to the client should the need arise and the specific requirement warrants such
        service.</li>
      <li> <strong>Sales Outlets and Service Outlets</strong>: A single outlet may provide both sales and service.
        The Offeror has identified its sales and service outlets in its offer and acknowledges that
        these sales and service outlets will be posted on the IPMG website. The Offeror must
        inform the PWGSC Contracting Authority, in writing, of any changes in the list of sales
        and service outlets during the Standing Offer Period. The Offeror must submit changes to
        the list, in the format prescribed by the Contracting Authority, for posting on the IPMG
        website.</li>
      <li> <strong>Status of Sales and Service Outlets as Subcontractors or Authorized Agents</strong>: Any
        sales or service outlets not owned and operated by the Offeror will be considered
        subcontractors under this Standing Offer and under any Call-ups against this Standing
        Offer, unless the operator of the sales and/or service outlet has also been designated by
        the Offeror as an Authorized Agent (in which case the Authorized Agent will act on the
        Offeror's behalf and can be contacted directly to make Call-ups). Refer to the Annex
      entitled &ldquo;Authorized Agent Certification&rdquo;.</li>
      <li><strong> Receipt of Payment by Authorized Agent</strong>: Canada is entitled to forward payment for
        contracts under this Standing Offer to the Offeror or to its Authorized Agent that
        performed the work. Receipt by the Authorized Agent of payment for any Call-up
        performed by that Authorized Agent on behalf of the Offeror will be deemed to be receipt
        by the Offeror of such payment.</li>
      <li><strong> Offeror Responsibility</strong>: Any subcontracting or agency relationship (through which the
        subcontractor or Authorized Agent performs contractual obligations on behalf of the
        Offeror) does not amend, diminish or modify any of the responsibilities of the Offeror under this Standing Offer. The Offeror agrees and understands that it is the responsibility
        of the Offeror to ensure that all of its Authorized Agents and subcontractors conform to
        the terms and conditions of the Standing Offer and complete any Call-ups in accordance
        with their terms and conditions. If an Authorized Agent or subcontractor fails to fulfill the
        obligations of any Call-up, the Offeror must, upon written notification from the PWGSC
        Contacting Authority, immediately complete and fulfill those obligations directly at no
        additional cost to Canada.</li>

<h3><a name="so11" id="so11"></a>11A. Certifications</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Compliance</strong><br />
    Compliance with the certifications provided by the Offeror is a condition of authorization of the
    Standing Offer and subject to verification by Canada during the term of the Standing Offer and of
    any resulting contract that would continue beyond the period of the Standing Offer. In the event
    that the Offeror does not comply with any certification or it is determined that any certification
    made by the Offeror in its offer is untrue, whether made knowingly or unknowingly, Canada has
    the right to terminate any resulting contract for default and set aside the Standing Offer.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="so12" id="so12"></a>12A. Applicable Laws</h3>
<p>The Standing Offer and any contract resulting from the Standing Offer must be interpreted and governed,
and the relations between the parties determined, by the laws in force in British Columbia.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="so13" id="so13"></a>13A. Downward Price Revision</h3>
<p>PWGSC will allow all Offerors (both Inactive and Active) in each Sub-Category to reduce their pricing
  voluntarily every month. Written notification of requested changes must be received by the Contracting
  Authority a minimum of five (5) working days prior to the last day of the month and the Value Factor will be<br />
adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p> Canada reserves the right to revise this time period if necessary.</p>
<p> During the Standing Offer Period, PWGSC reserves the right to specify an alternative downward price
  revision process at their sole discretion. Offerors will be given sufficient notification of any changes to the
  downward price revision process.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>Promotional Pricing</strong><br />
    Promotional pricing may be offered for all listed products and is defined as temporary pricing that
    is put in place for one month at a time without lowering the ceiling price of the item. Promotional
    pricing must be requested at the time of submission of downward price revisions, but will be
    applied only for Offerors that have been identified as Active Offerors for that period in accordance
    with 14 &ldquo;Identification of Active Offerors&rdquo;. Offerors may choose to both request a reduction of their
    ceiling price in order to increase the likelihood that they will remain Active (and therefore able to
    post their sale pricing) and request a Promotional Price, concurrently. Promotional pricing must be
    in the form of price reductions only.<br />
    <br />
    Promotional prices on products, on the upgrade of the warranty service from one year to four
    years, and on the installation, will impact the order of selection for the Call-up Limitations, but will
    not displace vendors who had been accepted as Active Offerors for the period before the
    application of the Promotional Pricing.<br />
    <br />
    Promotional prices on optional equipment are permissible.</li>

<h3><a name="so14" id="so14"></a>14A. Identification of Active Offerors</h3>
<p>The downward price revision process will allow PWGSC to identify, for the next one-month period, the
  Offerors for each Sub-Category having products with Value Factors falling within 20% of the best Value
  Factor on a per Sub-Category basis. These Offerors are referred to as the &quot;Active Offerors&quot;, as only their
  Products will be available to Identified Users for Call-ups during the one-month period. For this one-month
  period, the new Active Offerors and their prices will be posted in the Best Value Grid for use on the first
British Columbian business day of the one-month period following receipt of the price revision request.</p>

<p>If an individual contract made under this Standing offer is terminated, for default or otherwise, that

<p>If the number of Offerors for any given Category or Sub-Category is reduced during the Standing Offer
  Period for any reason (including setting aside authority to use a Standing Offer or voluntary withdrawal by
  the Offeror), Canada may, in its sole discretion, do one or more of the following in respect of any Category
or Sub-Category:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>  leave the Category or Sub-Category &quot;as is&quot; (i.e., the Standing Offers of the remaining Offerors will
    remain available for Call-ups and no new Offerors will be added);</li>
  <li>call for new Offers in respect of one or more affected Category or Sub-Category through the
    Government Electronic Tendering Service; or</li>
  <li> contact the Offeror (if any) whose offered Product complied with all the requirements of the
    Request for Standing Offer that resulted in the issuance of this Standing Offer, but who was not
    issued a Standing Offer because the Product&rsquo;s evaluated price was not within 50% of the Lowest
    Evaluated Cost in the relevant Category(ies), and the new Offeror agrees to meet or better an
    Evaluated Cost within 20% of the Lowest Evaluated Cost in the relevant Sub-Category(ies) of the
    existing Product(s) of the Offeror whose Standing Offer has been cancelled; then that new Offeror
    may be issued a Standing Offer in the applicable Group and Category. If the new Offeror does not
    agree to offer their product within 20% of the Lowest Evaluated Cost in the relevant Category(ies),
    no Standing Offer will be issued to that Offeror and Canada may, but will have no obligation to,

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Delivery, Inspection and Acceptance of Products</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li><strong> Compatibility Sub-Test</strong><br />
    For any Call-up of five (5) Products or more, an Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority
    may specify in the Call-up that the Offeror provide a Product in the configuration(s) required for a
    compatibility sub-test, prior to delivery of the products, to determine whether the ordered
    Product(s) will meet the Identified User&rsquo;s compatibility requirements. To complete these tests, the
    Offeror must deliver and set up, (at any location designated by Canada, as long as it is within a
    radius of 100 km of any city or town with a population of at least 30,000, except CLCA areas)
    within 3 working days, up to two (2) of the product(s) for testing. Product(s) provided for
    compatibility sub- testing will be delivered and set up at no additional cost to the Identified User.<br />
    <br />
  The products delivered for testing must:
  <ol type="i">
    <li>  be configured in accordance with the Identified Users actual requirements;</li>
    <li> be loaded with all necessary drivers; and</li>
    <li> be compatible with the specific hardware, network or software requirements identified by
      the Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority at the time notice of testing is given to
      the Offeror.<br />
      <br /></li></ol>
      If the testing indicates that some upgrades/changes (for example, to the drivers or firmware) are
      required, Canada will work with the Offeror to resolve these issues, provided they are reasonable
      within a reasonable period. If testing demonstrates that a Product is not compatible with the
      Identified User&rsquo;s particular environment, the Call-up may be cancelled in its entirety and the next
      highest Active Offeror will be considered, for the purposes of the Call-up Limitations, to have the
      Product with the best Value Factor.<br />
      <br />
      If the test unit provided is new and is to be delivered to the end-user's location, and if it is agreed
      upon with the Identified User, the test unit may be considered as the first unit of the subsequent
      delivery. Once compatibility is assured, arrangements will be made for delivery of the rest of the
      order.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Delivery of Products</strong>
    <ol type="i">

  <li><strong> Discounts for Late Deliveries &amp; Reimbursement of Reprocurement Costs</strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> If the Contractor fails to deliver any Products by the Delivery Date and Canada does not

        total value of the Call-up.</li>
      <li> If the Contractor is late in delivering only part of the Products ordered on a Call-up, and

        price of the Products delivered late by 15%, up to a maximum of 5% of the total value of
        the Call-up.</li>
      <li> These discounts constitute liquidated damages and the Parties agree that these amounts
        are their best pre-estimate of the loss to Canada in the event of the defaults described,
        and that they are not a penalty.</li>
      <li> If this Contract is terminated by Canada for default, the Contractor must reimburse
        Canada for any difference in cost between the price of the Products and the cost of
        procuring the Products from another supplier.</li>

        or set off from and against any money Canada owes to the Contractor from time to time.</li>

        where the court determines that the Parties are jointly and severally liable or that one Party is solely and
        directly liable to the third party. The amount of the liability will be the amount set out in the settlement

  Service) in Supplemental General Conditions 4001, the Contractor agrees to provide the following
Warranty Services:</p>
<p> <strong>9B.1.1 Warranty Period</strong>: The Warranty Period under this Contract is 12 months, unless the Identified
  User purchases an upgrade to the warranty (either at the time of purchase of the Product or at any time
before the expiry of the initial one-year on-site warranty).</p>
<p> <strong>9B.1.2 Beginning of Warranty Period</strong>: The Warranty Period begins on the Acceptance Date for each
  Product (and, therefore, the Warranty Period may begin on different dates for different Products under this
Contract, if they were delivered and/or accepted on different dates).</p>
<p> <strong>9B.1.3 Warranty Services</strong>: The warranty services to be provided by the Contractor include On-Site
Warranty Maintenance and Warranty Technical Support as described in this Contract (collectively, the&ldquo;<strong>Warranty Services</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
<p> <strong>9B.1.4 Parts</strong>: The Contractor guarantees that all parts and technical materials required to provide the
  Warranty Services will be available for 4 years from the date of the Call-up. All parts supplied by the
  Contractor in performing any maintenance services must be new, unused or certified equal quality.</p>
<p> <strong>9B.1.5 Warranty Service Calls</strong>: Identified Users may contact:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> any service outlet identified by the Contractor at the telephone number on the IPMG
    website (which must accept service calls from all Identified users, anywhere in Canada,
    during the hours of 08:00 to 17:00 in the local time where the service outlet is located,
    Monday through Friday, excluding statutory holidays); or<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> the Offeror&rsquo;s single toll-free Maintenance Dispatch Number (which must accept service
    calls from all Identified Users, anywhere in Canada, during the hours of 08:00 to 17:00
    across all time zones across Canada, Monday through Friday, excluding statutory
    holidays).<br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9B.1.6 Warranty Services included in Product Price</strong>: The cost of all parts, labour, travel and any other
related costs associated with the Warranty Services are included in the unit price of the Products and
associated meter charges, if applicable, and no additional payments will be made for the Warranty
Services, regardless of the location from which the Warranty Services are provided.</p>
<p><strong>9B.1.7 Change in Identified User</strong>: The Contractor&rsquo;s obligation to provide the Warranty Services will not
be affected by any change in the Identified User of the Product(s).</p>
<p><strong>9B.2 On-Site Warranty Maintenance Services</strong><br />
  As part of the Warranty Services, the Contractor accepts prime responsibility for the diagnosis and
  resolution of all problems that occur in the Products (including software issues and compatibility with the
  Identified User&rsquo;s network) throughout the Warranty Period. Maintenance Service provided must be such
  that the supplied Products are kept in good working condition at all times. The Contractor will provide the
  maintenance services described in section 25 of 4001 (2010-01-11) Supplemental General Conditions -
Hardware Purchase, Lease and Maintenance as follows:</p>
<p> <strong>9B2.1 Principal Period of Maintenance</strong>: The Contractor must perform the On-site Warranty Services
  during the Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM), which is defined as the continuous period during the
  hours of 08:00 to 17:00 (local time in all time zones across Canada), Monday through Friday, excluding
  statutory holidays.</p>
<p>  <strong>9B2.2 Remedial Maintenance</strong>:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> The Contractor must perform remedial maintenance services, as and when requested by
    Identified users.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> When Canada requests remedial maintenance, the Contractor&rsquo;s service representative
    must respond within 24 hours. Service response time does not include Saturdays,
    Sundays or statutory holidays. Response time is calculated from the time the Contractor,
    its Authorized Agent or Service Outlet has been notified by the Identified User until the
    Contractor&rsquo;s technician arrives on site, regardless of the location from which the
    maintenance services are provided.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> Upon commencing maintenance services, the technician must work continuously
    throughout the PPM until the Product is returned to operation in accordance with the
    Technical Specifications in Annex A and the Product Details or until notified by Canada to
    suspend the work.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> If, after arrival by the Contractor&rsquo;s technician on site, the Contractor determines that it
    cannot repair the Product within two (2) working days, then the Contractor must provide a
    loaner unit, similarly equipped as the Product being repaired, at no charge within five (5)
    working days of making this determination. A product being replaced or any of its
    components which contain the Identified User&rsquo;s information will be securely erased prior
    to removal from the Identified User&rsquo;s site, or the Product or applicable component will be
    left in the possession of the Identified User. The Identified User must be permitted to
    keep the loaner unit until the original Product is repaired and returned in working condition
    to the Identified user. The Contractor must provide restoration and hardware-specific
    configuration on the loaner equipment and upon return of the original Product.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> The Contractor must continue to provide Warranty Services for any part of any delivered
    Product that is repaired, replaces or otherwise made good as part of the Warranty
    Services for the remainder of the Warranty Period that applied to the original Product.<br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9B2.3 Preventative Maintenance</strong>: If required for the continuous operation of the Product, preventative
maintenance (required to inspect, lubricate and adjust the equipment) must be performed during the
Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM). This service must be performed at the level and frequency
recommended by the manufacturer and in accordance with the OEM specifications, or as otherwise
agreed between the Identified User and the Offeror. The cost of this maintenance is included in the price
of the Product, plus any additional meter charges, if applicable, beyond the specified included yield.</p>
<p><strong>9B2.4 Hot Swap Service</strong>: If agreed upon by the Authorized User, Hot Swap Warranty Service may be
  provided instead of on-site Warranty Service, either on a per-service-call basis or throughout the Warranty
  Period. In the latter case, the Authorized User must have approved this at the time of the Call-up, in
  writing. Where a Warranty Service call is made that cannot be resolved by telephone and Hot Swap
  Service applies, the Offeror must, within 24 hours, send to the Authorized User, postage paid, a
  replacement Product that is substantially equal to the Product being replaced, in that it is of similar age or
  better and able to perform all functions of the Product being replaced. Upon receipt of the replacement
  Product, the Authorized User will return the defective Product to the Offeror or manufacturer, as
  applicable, in appropriate packaging with the shipping paid by the Offeror. If the Authorized User is not
  satisfied that the replacement Product is substantially equal, the Contractor must supply another
replacement. The Contractor must continue to provide the Warranty Services for the replacement Product.</p>
<p> <strong>9B2.5 Software Support</strong>: The Licensed Software must be to the latest version released, unless
  otherwise specified, and must be provided with the standard software publisher&rsquo;s warranty and customer
  support. The Contractor must specify the duration and level of coverage of the software publisher&rsquo;s
  standard warranty (e.g., one-year hotline support).</p>
<p> <strong>9B2.6 Maintenance Reports</strong>: For each visit to perform On-site Warranty Services, a Warranty Service
  maintenance report must be prepared by the Contractor&rsquo;s technician. It must include the following:</p>

that during Warranty Period, Canada may exercise the remedial actions set out in 6B.3.3 below.</p>
<p> The failure of Canada to exercise any or all of the following remedies does not mean that the service
  received conforms with the applicable mandatory requirements, nor will that failure lower the level of
service acceptable for any portion of the Standing Offer.</p>
<p> The Offeror will not be responsible for any deficiencies arising from any use of the equipment by the
  Identified User that is inconsistent with practices or procedures published by the OEM or any other
procedure previously published by the Offeror and accepted by the Identified User.</p>
<p> It is not the intention of Canada to enforce the following remedies for situations resulting from acts of God,
civil insurrection, or in general, factors beyond the reasonable control of the Offeror.</p>
<p> Application of any of the remedies detailed below in one or more instances will not prevent Canada from
terminating for default in any instance of nonconformity with the terms of the Standing Offer.</p>
<p> The application of any remedy will not result in any increase in liability to Canada nor does it constitute
waiver of any rights available to it.</p>
<p><strong>  9B.3.1 Process to Claim Remedy</strong><br />

  reports, records of correspondence and chronology of incident(s) and unacceptable service, etc. to
support such claim.</p>
<p> Where the application of any remedy results in a financial benefit in favour of Canada, then such financial
  benefit will be applied as a credit to the applicable invoice for the maintenance billing period following the
maintenance billing period in which the claim was received by the Offeror.</p>
<p> Where the application of any remedy results in the requirement of the Offeror to replace equipment, then
such replacement equipment must be installed within 24 hours of receipt of the claim, by the Offeror.</p>
<p> Where the application of any remedy results in the requirement of the Offeror to provide additional reports
  or other documentation, then such reports or other written documentation must be provided within 30 days
of receipt of the claim, by the Offeror.</p>

    measured over a 30 day period of the number of times such services were required in accordance
    with the individual Contract; then, the Offeror must provide a Remedial Action Plan to the Identified
    User to identify what steps will be taken by the Offeror to remedy the situation. In the event that the

<h3><a name="anAer"></a>A3. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of all environmental certifications and programs that are mandatory:</p>
<blockquote>  
  <p><strong>A3.1 ISO 14001 Certification</strong><br />
    The Offeror (or its Original Equipment Manufacturer) must be registered under ISO 14001 from a
    nationally accredited registrar under the ISO 14001 Program for the manufacturing facility where the
    products being offered as part of this Standing Offer are manufactured.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>A3.2 Consumables Container Recycling Program</strong><br />
    The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing consumables
  container recycling program as per the following:</p>
  <p>    For all locations in Canada covered by this NMSO where consumables containers cannot be
    recycled through local &ldquo;blue-box&rdquo; recycling programs, the Offeror must provide its own consumables
    recycling program by either:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  providing prepaid, postage-return packaging with the consumable when it is originally<br />
      delivered, or available for download from the manufacturer&rsquo;s website; OR<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> picking up used consumables containers at no charge.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> <strong>A3.2 Packaging Recycling</strong><br />
    The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing packaging
    recycling program as per the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped must be recyclable.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> The Offeror must take back all packaging from the Identified User&rsquo;s site at the time of
      product installation.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> The Contractor must reuse, recycle or dispose of all packaging materials removed from
      Products delivered under any Call-up in an environmentally sensitive manner.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>A3.3 Energy Star Registration</strong><br />
    The Offeror's product must be Energy Star qualified at the time of product acceptance. The
    vendor must ship all products with the Energy Star low-power feature activated or enabled. This
    eliminates the need for users to configure the power-management feature after delivery and helps
    to ensure that they use the energy-saving feature.   </p>
  <p> <strong>A3.4 Third Party Environmental Ecolabelling</strong><br />
    The Offeror must have a Third Party Environmental Ecolabelling certification for each Product (or
    a certification that clearly covers multiple Products), which certification may be in the name of the
    licensee, if permitted (in which case the Offeror must demonstrate, upon request, that it is
    permitted to have the certification in the name of the licensee); Acceptable programs are those
    recognized by the Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN).</p>

    Identified User feels that there are administrative advantages in contracting with one supplier only
    for the requirement, the Identified User is encouraged to calculate the best value for the
    aggregate requirement. The Call-up limitations defined the Annex entitled &ldquo;Call-Up Limitations&rdquo; will
    apply to any such aggregate requirement and permission must be received from the Standing Offer Authority whenever the aggregate best value would include Products that are not Active.
    Where the value or volume of the inactive product or products exceeds that of the Active
    products, the whole requirement will be treated as an exception and the Identified User will need
    written permission of the Standing Offer Authority before they can make the Call-up.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> <strong>For Call-ups of Additional Items only:</strong> the Identified User may place Call-ups valued at up to
    $25,000.00 GST/HST included that consist of Additional Items or consumables only, from any of
    the Offerors (both Active and Inactive). Any Call-ups of Additional Items exceeding $25,000.00<br />
    must be issued or approved in writing by the Standing Offer Authority.<br />
    <br />

        Identified User, </li>
    </ol>
  <p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up (or the Identified User requests and

    <p> then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up with one of the Inactive Offerors in the
      relevant category that can satisfy these requirements, at the unit price(s) that Offeror offered
      during the most recent downward price revision or the Standing Offer Authority may use other
      sourcing methods to procure the Products. Only the Standing Offer Authority can place Call-ups
      with Inactive Offerors. The Offeror agrees not to accept any Call-ups, except from the Standing
    Offer Authority, while it is not an Active Offeror.</p>

  PRODUCT SUBSTITUTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>D1. EQUIPMENT SUBSTITUTION</strong><br />
  Equipment substitutions or delivery of equipment other than specified in the Standing Offer will not be
  accepted and may result in the withdrawal of authority from the Identified Users to utilize the Standing
Offer.</p>
<p> <strong>D2. SUBSTITUTION OF INTERNAL COMPONENTS</strong><br />
  If the Offeror wishes to substitute internal components of an existing NMSO product, the substitution must
  have completed any required benchmark testing and be approved by the Standing Offer Authority prior to
  acceptance of Call-ups for that equipment and delivery to any Identified User.</p>
<p> <strong>D3. SUBSTITUTION OF PRODUCTS</strong><br />
  In the event that the Offeror wishes to propose a substitution for an existing NMSO product, Active or
  Inactive, the Offeror must submit a Request for Substitution, as detailed below to the PWGSC Standing
  Offer Authority. The Offeror agrees and understands that the proposed substitution must be a new product
  that was not available for offer or testing on the closing date of the initial RFSO, that the equipment must
  meet or exceed the base specification(s) of the sub-category into which it is being substituted and that it
  must have an equal or lower ratio of dollar of cost per Benchmark point than the product being substituted
  for.</p>
<p>  Products submitted as a substitution may only be submitted into a sub-category where the Offeror already
  has a currently offered product. If the substitution is successful and the new product is accepted, the
  subbed-out product will be removed.</p>
<p> The proposed substitution will be subject to benchmark evaluation and all applicable costs (e.g.
  transportation, benchmark fee, etc.) will be at the Offeror's expense. Offerors who are substituting their
  products on the NMSO must comply with the testing guidelines outlined in Annex H.</p>
<p> The Offeror agrees and understands that Canada reserves the right to accept or reject any proposed
  substitutions. The Offeror agrees that no substitute items will be shipped until formally authorized by
  PWGSC in writing.</p>
<p> <strong>D4. INTERIM BENCHMARK TESTING TIME FRAMES</strong><br />
  Interim benchmark testing will be performed on demand. INTERTEK will accept equipment for testing at
  the request of the Standing Offer Authority with a minimum of 15 calendar days notice. INTERTEK will
  complete the tests and provide spreadsheet results to PWGSC within 20 calendar days. PWGSC will
  advise INTERTEK of the acceptance or rejection of the product as a substitution and will post the new
  pricing information of accepted products on the next Product and Pricing Refresh Date. INTERTEK will
  revise the Benchmark Report data for the NSTL/IPMG web site and post it on the next Product and
  Pricing Refresh Date after notification of acceptance.</p>
<p> <strong>D5. NOTIFICATION OF REQUEST FOR SUBSTITUTION</strong><br />
  To initiate the substitution procedure, the Authorized Representative of the Offeror must submit by e-mail
  or paper copy, a Request for Substitution to the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority (or their Designate), in
  accordance with schedule posted on the Best Value Grid on the IPMG website, giving full details about the
  proposed change, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>the name and part number of the new product;</li>
  <li> the sub-category into which it is offered;</li>
  <li> the name and part number of the product that is to be replaced</li>
  <li> the date from which the product would be available for testing; and,</li>
  <li> the desired Product and Pricing Refresh Date for posting, if accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>D6. SUBSTITUTION SUBMISSION</strong><br />
  This request must be accompanied, or closely followed, by full electronic or paper copy documentation
including:</p>
<ol>
  <li> a printout (from the NSTL submission site) of the appropriate Annex - Technical Details for each
    product offered, including the signed certification that the product meets or exceeds the base
    specification(s) of the sub-category into which it is being substituted;<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> a printout (from the NSTL submission site) of the appropriate Annex - Financial Details for each
    product offered, in accordance with the guidelines of the initial RFSO.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> Technical Documentation:
    <ol type="i">
      <li> Advertising and technical literature that substantiates the compliance of the Product with
        each and every mandatory requirement in Annex A for the appropriate Group and
        Category (including the overall Mandatory General Specifications set out in Annex A).
        Offerors are requested to indicate the page and paragraph number where substantiation
        regarding each of the mandatory requirements in Annex A can be found. This technical
        documentation must be provided in both official languages.</li>
      <li> proof of English and French or bilingual (English/French) user manuals (either the Index
        or Table of Contents is sufficient).</li>
      <li> Proof that the Product:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>  is certified by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) or Underwriters
            Laboratory Canadian equivalent (ULC) or Underwriters Laboratory Inc. (ULI) in
            accordance with the requirements of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I;</li>
          <li> is certified by the manufacturer as complying with the Class A or B limits for radio
            noise emissions from digital apparatus set out in the Interference Causing
            Equipment Standard (ICES-003) of Industry Canada, or US FCC Class A or B
            equivalent emission limits for digital apparatus as set in the Radio Interference
            Regulations;</li>
          <li> is Energy Star qualified at the time of product acceptance. The vendor must ship
            all products with the Energy Star low-power feature activated or enabled;</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>D7. DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS</strong><br />
  The Offeror must immediately notify the PWGSC Standing Offer Authority if any Product listed in this
    Standing Offer is discontinued or is otherwise unavailable (e.g., End of Life). The Offeror may propose a
    substitution, as set out above, within 60 days of providing such notice. The discontinued or unavailable
    Product will be removed by PWGSC from this Standing Offer, but the &quot;place&quot; held by that Product will be
    held pending submission of a request for substitution, provided it is made in accordance with this Article
    and within 60 days of providing notice of the lack of availability. If a request for substitution is not made
    within those 60 days, a substitution request may not be granted, in which case the Product will no longer
    be included in the Standing Offer without the possibility of being reinstated. For the purposes of
    calculating Evaluated Price, a Product that has been removed will have a value assigned to it equal to the
most expensive equivalent product offered by the other Offerors in the same Category.</p>
<p><strong> D8. ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSTITUTION DISCRETIONARY</strong><br />
  Whether or not to accept or reject a proposed substitution is entirely within the discretion of Canada. If
  Canada does not accept a proposed substitution, the original Product will continue to be authorized under
  this Standing Offer, unless the Offeror withdraws that Product from the Standing Offer. The Offeror agrees
  that no substitute items may be shipped under a Call-up until formally authorized by PWGSC in writing
and posted in the Best Value Grid on the IPMG website.</p>
<p><strong> D9. DOCUMENTATION OF ACCEPTED SUBSTITUTION</strong><br />
  If a substitute Product is approved for supply under this Standing Offer, it will be listed in the Best Value
  Grid and will be available for purchase on Call-ups. Approved substitutions cannot be supplied under a
  Call-up until posted in the Best Value Grid. In the case of a Call-up, the substitution must be posted at the
  time the Call-up is issued; otherwise, the item posted in the Best Value Grid at the time the Call-up was
issued must be supplied.</p>
<p>  <strong>IN CASE OF ANY DISCREPANCIES, THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS RETAINED BY THE PWGSC
  STANDING OFFER AUTHORITY WILL PREVAIL.</strong>

<h2 align="center"><a name="anG" id="anG"></a>ANNEX G<br />
  DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF VALUE FACTOR</h2>
<p><strong>G1. DEFINITION OF &ldquo;VALUE FACTOR&rdquo;</strong><br />
  &ldquo;<strong>Value Factor</strong>&rdquo; is the term used in this Standing Offer to define the calculations used to determine the
  Products offering the best value to the Government of Canada, based on the evaluated price and the
  benchmark score for that Product. The best Value Factor is the Product with the highest score for Value
Factor in accordance with this Annex.</p>
<p> The Value Factor will be determined in order to select Offerors for issuance of resulting Standing Offers,
  to determine the applicable Call-up Limitation, and to determine the &quot;Active Offerors&quot; during each
  one-month period following a downward price revision.</p>
<p>The Value Factor for each product will be calculated based on two elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li> the Evaluated Price (calculated as set out below); and</li>
  <li> the total Benchmark Score.</li>
</ol>
<p> The best Value Factor determined at the time of a Call-up may depend on the exact configuration required
  to meet the Identified User&rsquo;s requirements. If substantial reconfiguration is required, a recalculation of the
  Value Factors will be completed for the specific requirement.</p>
<p><strong> G2. STEP 1 - CALCULATION OF &ldquo;EVALUATED PRICE&rdquo;</strong><br />
  Within each Sub-Category of printers the &ldquo;<strong>Evaluated Price</strong>&rdquo; per unit will be the sum of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>	 The weighted average of the unit prices (each unit price must be equal to or lower than that of the
    preceeding order size tier) submitted for the five pricing tiers for the printer (including all equipment
    required for the printer to meet the minimum specifications for the Sub-Category - for purposes of the
    financial and technical evaluation, all printers offered in network Sub-Categories must be configured
    and priced with an Ethernet 10/100 Base T or 100 Base T Network Interface Card), including one full
    set of initial consumables, user manuals, configuration, delivery, and the provision of one-year of
    Warranty Service (on-site where applicable, as described in the Resulting Contract clauses and Hot
  Swap Warranty Service for all other locations), inclusive of travel, labour and parts replacement.<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li> The weighted average of the unit prices (each unit price must be equal to or lower than that of the
    preceeding order size tier) submitted for the five identified tiers for the installation of the printer at final
    destination. The average installation price will be used to calculate the Evaluated Price for each unit
    offered, even though installation will not necessarily be requested by all Identified Users.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> The weighted average of the unit prices (each unit price must be equal to or lower than that of the
    preceeding order size tier) submitted for the five identified tiers for the upgrade of the Warranty
    Services from one year to four years, on-site where applicable, inclusive of all travel, labour and parts
    replacement.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> The Imaging Consumables Cost Factor (the total cost of imaging consumables, other than paper,
  to produce a specified number of prints at a specified page coverage).</li>
</ol>
  <p> The weights which will be used for the purposes of calculating the weighted average unit prices (a, b, and
    c) above, will be as follows for each sub-category:</p>

  <p><strong>G3. STEP 2 - BENCHMARK SCORE</strong><br />
    The Benchmark Score for all printers will be determined by NSTL/INTERTEK. The maximum Benchmark
    Score for each product is 10. See Annex H, Benchmark Testing, for details on the scoring methodology
  and allocation of points.</p>
  <p> <strong>G4. STEP 3 - CALCULATION OF &quot;VALUE FACTOR&quot;</strong><br />
    The elements will be combined at a ratio of 70% for Total Weighted Average of Cost Factor to 30% for
    benchmark points. The lowest Total Weighted Average of Cost Factor will achieve 70 points and all other
    Offerors' Total Weighted Average of Cost Factors will be pro-rated accordingly. The Offeror achieving the highest total benchmark points will achieve 30 points and all the other Offerors' total points will be
    pro-rated accordingly. The Value Factor will be the sum of the each of the two elements after they are
    prorated.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="anH" id="anH"></a>ANNEX H<br />
  BENCHMARK TESTING</h2>
<p><em><strong>Note to Offerors: The Benchmark Testing Procedures and Fees described in this Annex will apply to the
evaluation of Offers as well as to proposed substitutions during the Standing Offer Period.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>H1. OVERVIEW</strong><br />
  Benchmark tests on offered printers and MFP&rsquo;s are mandatory and must be conducted as part of the
  evaluation. The Benchmark tests must be conducted by the testing authority, INTERTEK Canada Corp,
  (formerly known as NSTL Canada Corp. (NSTL)), at the INTERTEK test site located in the National
  Capital Area. The benchmark procedures have been established in cooperation with INTERTEK. All
  questions and concerns about these procedures must be addressed to the Contracting Authority. Failure
  to comply with the benchmark test procedures may result in disqualification of an Offer without further
notice.</p>
<p> <strong>H2. NATURE OF TESTING</strong><br />
  The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation, unless the benchmark testing reveals that
  a printer does not meet a mandatory requirement of the solicitation. It is used to generate a score based
  on the performance (speed), quality of output, features and usability of the printer. This score is used in
  the determination of Value Factor. The data generated through the benchmark testing will be used for
  evaluation and posted on the IPMG site.</p>
<p><strong> H3. BENCHMARK TEST SCHEDULE</strong><br />
  Canada will submit a list of products to be benchmarked to INTERTEK. INTERTEK, in cooperation with
  the PWGSC Contracting Authority, will then draw up the Benchmark Test Schedule. Offerors will be
  notified by e-mail and/or facsimile of the Benchmark Test Schedule, at least seven (7) calendar days in
  advance. The notification will include the schedule of delivery dates for each Product to be tested, and
  detailed instructions regarding delivery of test units, supplies, documents and payments required for the
  benchmark tests. Failure to deliver the equipment and other items on the specified date(s) and time will
  result in disqualification if INTERTEK, in its sole discretion, determines that extending the deadline will
  have an impact on the overall testing schedule.</p>
<p> <strong>H4. EQUIPMENT DELIVERED FOR TESTING</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Equipment delivered for testing should be accompanied by: <br />

</blockquote>
<p> <strong>H9. USE OF PREVIOUS TEST DATA FOR EVALUATION OF THIS RFSO</strong><br />
  If a printer offered under this RFSO has previously been tested by NSTL for other requirements (including
  the NMSO#EZ107-060001/XXX/VAN series of Offers), any resulting test data may be used if NSTL
  determines that the data applies to this requirement. Decisions by NSTL will be final in this respect. An
  administration fee ($250.00) will be required to cover the costs of recompiling and posting the data for the
  new requirement. It is the Offeror's responsibility (at the time testing is scheduled with NSTL) to indicate
  where a printer has already been tested by NSTL so that the previous test data can be verified and testing
  for any missing data can be scheduled.</p>
<p><strong> H10. BENCHMARK TEST FEES</strong><br />
  Benchmark tests must be conducted by INTERTEK Canada Corp. INTERTEK is not part of the
  Government of Canada. The Offeror may be required to enter into an agreement with INTERTEK
  regarding the testing. All costs associated with the benchmark testing are the Offeror&rsquo;s responsibility. The
  cost for benchmark testing each printer will be in accordance with the Schedule of Benchmark Costs
  identified below, and is payable by certified cheque made out to INTERTEK. The fees below will apply
  during initial evaluation, but may be subject to change during the Standing Offer Period. The fees below
  include GST.</p>
<p> A certified cheque in the amount required must be delivered to INTERTEK before benchmark testing
  commences. Offerors submitting more than one printer may present one cheque for all printers or one
  cheque for each group of printers submitted for testing. Printers that are not paid for within 24 hours of
set-up will not be tested.</p>
<p> Exceptions:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>  Products offered in the Monochrome Network Laser Printer Category that are also offered in any
    Monochrome Standalone Laser Printer Sub-Categories will be subject to an additional cost of
    $901.00/unit per additional Sub-Category tested (instead of the Sub-Category fee set out above).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Products offered in Network Colour Page Sub-Categories that are also offered in any Standalone
    Colour Page Printer Sub-Categories will be subject to an additional cost of $901.00/unit per
  Sub-Category tested (instead of the Sub-Category fee set out above).<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Where an otherwise identical printer is tested in a Multifunction Sub-Category, then in a Network
    Sub-Category, and then finally as a standalone printer, the Offeror will first pay the benchmark
    test fee for the multifunction printer Sub-Category, then an additional $1060.00/unit test fee for the
    network Sub-Category, and finally a $901.00/unit test fee for the standalone Sub-Category
    (instead of the Sub-Category fees set out above).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  For any printer model being tested for more than one Sub-Category, if the model is configured
    identically in each Sub-Category for which it is offered (so that the benchmark tests can be run
    just once) to obtain data for all Sub-Categories, the benchmark fee for that printer will only be
    payable once, with an additional administrative fee of $530.00 per additional Sub-Category in
    which it is offered.</li>

<p><em><strong>Note to Offerors: Offerors who wish to benefit from the reduced benchmark testing prices
  associated with rolling over data or the application of data from one Sub-Category to another,
  as described above, must identify this either in their Offer or to INTERTEK at the time testing
is scheduled. Otherwise, the full fees may be charged by INTERTEK.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>H11. BENCHMARK TESTING AND SCORING METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
<p> NSTL/INTERTEK technicians will evaluate each printer submitted to the benchmark as follows:</p>
<p> Testing will consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Performance</li>
  <li> Features</li>
  <li> Usability</li>
  <li> Quality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H11.1 Overall Printer Score Methodology</strong></p>
<p> An overall score for each printer will be derived by averaging the weighted scores for each of the four
  major NSTL tests: speed, quality, features and usability. Weights for each of the tests are determined by
  individual client needs. The final overall scores are presented on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10
  representing the best possible score in a single category.</p>

<p><strong>  H11.2 Speed Scoring Methodology<br />
</strong>The Speed of each printer will be tested using a series of predetermined files. NSTL uses a number of
  real world application files in order to give a more realistic indication of the printer capabilities. The files
  were created using Microsoft office, Adobe Acrobat, and AutoCAD applications. Each file type contains
  one or more of the following elements: graphics sparse text, dense text, fonts, bit-mapped images. The
  Microsoft Word document contains text, embedded Excel charts, and graphic images. The Microsoft
  Excel document contains a combination of simple spreadsheets, and a variety of charts. The PowerPoint
  file is a basic presentation including text and graphics. The Adobe Acrobat PDF file is similar in form to
many PDF files in use today, it contains a combination of text and graphics.</p>
<p> A printer's raw score on any given test is the time it takes to generate one of the predetermined files. All
  tests will be performed at least twice to check for relative consistency. All raw scores will be recorded in
  number of seconds. If the speed times for two runs of the test vary more than 5%, NSTL will rerun the test
  until two scores obtained are within a 5% degree of variance.</p>
<p> <strong>H11.3 Quality Scoring Methodology</strong><br />
NSTL rates the quality of all printers using the following test categories, where applicable:</p>
<p> Monochrome objectives<br />
  Colour objectives</p>
<p> The quality of each printer is evaluated by NSTL using the output from several Postscript files. Quality
  testing will be conducted at the highest resolution and quality settings available for the product. In order to
  create comparable quality tests for printers which may not have PostScript capability, NSTL has
  developed its own PostScript interpreter, as a part of its&rsquo; test suite. The quality output contains both
  subjective and objective scoring. However, the subjective scoring applies only to the colour printers.</p>
<p> <strong>Objective tests:</strong><br />
  The monochrome quality tests consist of a series of pages containing such elements as a photographic
  image, text in a wide range of sizes, and a variety of circles and horizontal and vertical lines. These tests
  also stress more esoteric features, such as the printer's paper-handling ability and how well the printer
  displays reversed (white on black) text and graphics. These tests demonstrate a printer's suitability for
  graphics-oriented applications. The colour quality test examines the ability of the printer to print a wide range of hues as well as to blend between the hues. It also examines ink placement problems - the ability
  of the printer to accurately place lines without misregistration or smearing. These tests are self-scoring
  and absolute in that each score is only a function of the particular printer's abilities, it does not compare
  one printer against another.</p>
<p><strong> Subjective tests:</strong><br />
  One output consists of a set of five photographs scanned on an HP IICX scanner. They were scanned at
  200x200 dpi, 24 bits per pixel. Two other images are composites of photographs scanned at 600x600 dpi.
  The files are full-page images, a bit larger than 8.5x11 inches. The quality of these pages are judged
  relative to the other printers in the grouping. When quality output from all printers in a category is
  completed, a NSTL technician will group the output into different categories. Although output will be
  marked on the back to identify the printer from which it came, the tester evaluating the quality of the output
  on the printed side of each sheet will not know which printer produced any given sheet of output. The
  technician will judge each element of the output in a given category on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1
  representing the relatively worst output and 5 representing the relatively best output.</p>
<p> Each quality output file will be generated on both paper provided by the printer vendor and transparencies.</p>
<p> To calculate the overall quality score for each printer, the ratings assigned to each major element will be
  averaged for each image printed; an average of all of the scores will be calculated to achieve a score for
  both vendor paper and transparencies. The scaled quality score will be calculated, by multiplying the
scaled objective score by 0.8 and adding the result to 0.2 times the scaled subjective score.</p>
<p> The final score for each printer will be adjusted to a 10-point scale for easy comparison. An overall quality
  score of 10 thus represents the highest possible score for a printer in a category.</p>
<p> <strong>H11.4 Features Scoring Methodology:</strong><br />
  Prior to the beginning of benchmark testing, vendors will be issued a features questionnaire for each
  printer they are submitting. The questionnaire will consist of more than 70 items for which vendors specify
  the particular attributes for each printer. During the course of benchmark testing, NSTL technicians will
  review the features questionnaire and verify the responses against the printer and documentation which
  will be provided for the benchmark. Individual features for each printer are tabulated in the results section
  of the report.</p>
<p> The verified features for each printer will be scored according to the following methodology. A number of
  items are assigned weights and scored (e.g., auto switching between ports). Weighted items are assigned
  a weight from 0.5 to 2. Exact weights for each item will be found in the first column of the features table in
  the data section of the report. A printer receives a score of &quot;1&quot; for each weighted feature it includes. The
  printer receives a score of &quot;0&quot; for each weighted feature it does not include. If an item is listed as optional,
  the printer receives a score of &quot;.5&quot; for that item. All items for each printer are then multiplied by the
  corresponding weight and compared to the total possible number of points for the category. The final
  score for each printer will be adjusted to a 10-point scale for easy comparison. An overall features score
  of 10 thus represents the highest possible score for a printer on the features questionnaire.</p>
<p> Many of the items in the questionnaire are included for informational purposes only and are not used in
  the computation of the features score (e.g., voltages supported).</p>
<p> <strong>H11.5 Usability Scoring Methodology:</strong><br />
  During the course of benchmark testing, NSTL technicians will review and scored each printer on a
  number of predefined usability criteria. A list of those items is presented below. The NSTL technicians will work with the printer and documentation to perform some basic tasks such as setting up the printer,
  loading paper and changing some items on the printer's setup/control menu. Points will be assigned
  based on the functionality and ease of use of the printer.</p>
<p> An overall usability score will be derived by averaging the scores for all seven items. The final score for
  each printer is adjusted to a 10 point scale for easy comparison. An overall usability score of 10 thus
  represents the highest possible score for a printer on the usability questionnaire.</p>
