			<p><strong>B.21 Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
			<p> (a) 
			  Liability of Canada and the Contractor to Third Parties: Each Party
			    to this Contract agrees it is responsible to any third party
			    for injury or losses that the third party may suffer to the extent
			  such Party to this Contract caused them, where the third party has a cause
			    of action directly against that Party in respect of the injury
			  or losses. The Parties agree that with respect to such third party claims
			  against the Contractor, the Contractor will be responsible for damages arising
			    out of the injury or losses to the extent that it caused them,
			  including those situations where Canada may be required to pay the damages
			  caused by the Contractor as a result of joint and several liability. With
			  respect to third party claims where the third party does not have a cause
			  of action directly against the Party causing the damage, this Sub-article
			  (a) does not prevent or restrict in any way Canada's right to pursue and
			  enforce any rights that it may have against the Contractor. In the event
			  of any conflict between this Sub-article (a) and any other Sub-article of
		    this Article, this Sub-article (a) will prevail. </p>
			<p>(b) 
			  Extent of Contractor's Liability for Damages: Regardless of the
			  basis on which Canada may be entitled to claim damages from the
			    Contractor (whether in contract, tort or any other cause of action),
		    the Contractor is liable to Canada only for the following:</p>
			<p>(i) 
			  all damages and costs resulting from intellectual property right
			  infringement as set out in the Article entitled &quot;Intellectual Property
		    Infringement&quot;;</p>
			<p>(ii) 
			  all damages for physical injury, including death, caused by the
		    Contractor, its employees, agents or subcontractors;</p>
			<p>(iii)
			  all direct damages for loss of or physical harm to tangible property
			  and real property caused by the Contractor, its employees, agents
		    or subcontractors;</p>
			<p>(iv) 
		    all damages for breach of confidentiality;</p>
			<p>(v) 
			  all damages arising from claims for liens, attachments, charges
			  or other encumbrances or claims upon or in respect of any materials,
			  parts, work-in-process or finished work furnished to, or in respect
			  of which any payment has been made by, Canada, provided that this
			  Sub-article does not apply to claims of intellectual property infringement
		    which claims are covered in Sub-article (i) above; and,</p>
			<p>(vi)
			  any other direct damages caused by the Contractor, its employees,
			  agents or subcontractors in relation to this Contract, including
			  reprocurement costs as defined below, and restoration of records
			  to the extent that the Contractor fails to comply with Section
			  (d) below, up to an aggregate maximum for this Sub-article (b)
		    (vi) of the greater of 0.5 times the total estimated cost, or $1,000,000.00. </p>
			<p>(c) 
		    The Contractor will not be liable to Canada for the following:</p>
			<p>(i) damages of third parties claimed against Canada except those referred
			  to in Sub-article (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above; </p>
			<p>(ii) 
			  harm to Canada's records or data, except for the restoration set
			  out in Section (d) below, and subject to the limitation set out
			  in Sub-article (b)(vi) above; or</p>
			<p>(iii) 
			  special, indirect or consequential damages (other than the payments
			  referred to in Sub-article (b)(i) above, and the damages referred
			  to in Sub-article (b)(ii) above), even if the Contractor is made
			  aware of the potential for such damages, including lost profits
			  and lost savings.</p>
			<p>(d) Canada is responsible for maintaining adequate backup of its records
			  and data to enable their restoration if needed for any reason.
			  If Canada's records or data are harmed by the Contractor's or a
			  subcontractor's negligence or willful act, the Contractor is responsible
			  for restoring Canada's records and data to the same state as in
			  the last available backup copy.</p>
			<p>(e) 
			  For the purposes of this Article:</p>
			<p>(i) 
			  total estimated cost means the dollar amount shown on the first
			  page of the Contract in the cell titled &quot;Total Estimated Cost&quot;; </p>
			<p>(ii) 
			  reprocurement costs means all identifiable direct costs incurred
			  by Canada to reprocure the Work with another contractor, including
			  deinstallation and return of the Work to the Contractor, administrative
			  costs of selecting another contractor or retendering all or part
			  of the Contract, as applicable, and any increase in the price payable
			  by Canada for the other Work having equivalent functionality, performance
			  and quality; and, </p>
			<p>(iii) 
			  the term &quot;Contract&quot; applies to stand-alone contracts, and to each
			  call-up, purchase order and other contractual document, irrespective
			  of its title, issued under a Standing Offer or a Supply Arrangement.</p>
