			<p><strong>Offeror's Sales and Service Network</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A.21 Sales and Service Network</strong></p>
			<p>		      <strong>National/Regional Requirements: </strong>Canada requires delivery and
			      service throughout Canada, excluding CLCA areas. In this Standing Offer,
			      the regions where delivery and Warranty Services are required are defined
		        as follows:</p>
			<p>(i)
		      Pacific Region: British Columbia</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      Western Region: Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      Capital Region: the area within a radius of 100 km from Ottawa,
	          Ontario</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      Central Region: the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, excluding
	            the Capital Region</p>
			<p>(v)
		      Atlantic Region: the provinces East of Quebec</p>
			<p>		      For requirements with delivery points in parts of Canada
          not covered within these regions (i.e., CLCA areas, which
          include the Yukon, NWT, Nunavut, and other areas), other sourcing
          methods will be used. </p>
			<p>(b)<strong> Number of Sales Outlets:</strong> The Offeror must maintain a minimum
              of five (5) sales outlets, with at least one (1) outlet in
              each of the Pacific, Western, Central, Capital and Atlantic
	                  regions. The Offeror may satisfy this requirement itself
            or through its Authorized Agents or subcontractors.</p>
			<p>(c)
		      <strong>Number of Service Outlets:</strong> The Offeror must also be able to
                  provide the Warranty Services described in the Resulting
		      Contract clauses by maintaining, at a minimum:</p>
			<p>(i)		      Three (3) service outlets in EACH of the Western and Central
        regions, and</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      Two (2) service outlets in EACH of the Pacific, Atlantic and
              Capital regions.</p>
			<p>		      The Offeror may satisfy this requirement itself or through
        its Authorized Agents or subcontractors. Also, the Offeror
        may provide a single toll-free Maintenance Dispatch Number
        or a separate telephone number for the service outlets in each
        region.</p>
			<p>(d)
		      <strong>Sufficiency of Sales and Service Outlets: </strong>The Contracting Authority
                  may, at any time during the Standing Offer Period, verify
			      that sales and service outlets are available (and sufficiently
			  staffed) nationally to make deliveries and provide Warranty Services
                  within the time frames set out in the Resulting Contract
			      clauses. Sales outlets are defined as providing representation,
			  through either employees, agents, or subcontractors, in the applicable
                  region, familiar with the terms and conditions of the National
                  Master Standing Offer as well as with the Offeror's pricing
          and the technical details of the offered printers, and able to communicate
                  this information to Authorized Users. The main deliverable
          required from a Sales outlet is the ability to assist an Authorized
          User, if requested, with the determination their requirement; with
                  the interpretation of product information, and with the placement
                  of the subsequent call-up, in accordance with the terms of
          the agreement. The Sales outlets may be asked to provide pre-sales
                  assistance on-site and this option is to be available to
			      the client should the need arise and the specific requirement
			  warrants such service.</p>
			<p>(e)<strong> Sales Outlets and Service Outlets:</strong> A single outlet may provide
        both sales and service. The Offeror has identified its sales
        and service outlets in its offer and acknowledges that these
        sales and service outlets will be posted on the IPMG website.
        The Offeror must inform the PWGSC Contracting Authority, in
        writing, of any changes in the list of sales and service outlets
        during the Standing Offer Period. The Offeror must submit changes
        to the list, in the format prescribed by the Contracting Authority,
        for posting on the IPMG website and any ePurchasing sites.</p>
			<p>(f)<strong> Status of Sales and Service Outlets as Subcontractors
			    or Authorized Agents: </strong>Any sales or service outlets not owned and operated
                  by the Offeror will be considered subcontractors under this
                  Standing Offer and under any Call-ups against this Standing
                  Offer, unless the operator of the sales and/or service outlet
                  has also been designated by the Offeror as an Authorized
			      Agent (in which case the Authorized Agent will act on the Offeror's
                behalf and can be contacted directly to make Call-ups).</p>
			<p>(g)<strong> Receipt of Payment by Authorized Agent: </strong>Canada is entitled
        to forward payment for contracts under this Standing Offer
        to the Offeror or to its Authorized Agent that performed the
        work. Receipt by the Authorized Agent of payment for any Call-up
        performed by that Authorized Agent on behalf of the Offeror
        will be deemed to be receipt by the Offeror of such payment. </p>
			<p>(h)
		      <strong>Offeror Responsibility: </strong>Any subcontracting or agency relationship
                  (through which the subcontractor or Authorized Agent performs
                  contractual obligations on behalf of the Offeror) does not
                  amend, diminish or modify any of the responsibilities of
			      the Offeror under this Standing Offer. The Offeror agrees and
			  understands that it is the responsibility of the Offeror to ensure that
                  all of its Authorized Agents and subcontractors conform to
                  the terms and conditions of the Standing Offer and complete
          any Call-ups in accordance with their terms and conditions. If an
                  Authorized Agent or subcontractor fails to fulfill the obligations
                  of any Call-up, the Offeror must, upon written notification
          from the PWGSC Contacting Authority, immediately complete and fulfill
                  those obligations directly at no additional cost to Canada.</p>
