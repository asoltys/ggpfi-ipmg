			<p><strong>B.12 On-Site Warranty Maintenance</strong></p>
			<p>		      As part of the Warranty Services, the Contractor accepts prime
			      responsibility for the diagnosis and resolution of all problems
			      that occur in the Products (including software issues and compatibility
			      with the Authorized User's network) throughout the Warranty Period and
			      will provide the maintenance services described in Supplemental General
		        Conditions 9601-1 as follows:</p>
			<p>(a) <strong> Principal Period of Maintenance:</strong> The Contractor must perform
		        the On-site Warranty Services during the Principal Period of
			      Maintenance (PPM), which is defined as the continuous period
			  during the hours of 08:00 to 17:00 (local time in all time zones across
			  Canada), Monday through Friday, excluding statutory holidays.</p>
			<p>(b) <strong> Exception - Hot Swap Warranty Services:</strong> The Contractor is not
			        required to provide On-Site Warranty Maintenance services
			      for Products that are not located in Canada within a radius
			  of 100 km of any city or town with a population of at least 30,000 (except
			  CLCA areas), unless service to these other areas is within the scope
			      of the Contractor's or the manufacturer's standard warranty
			  for the printer model. For locations outside of these areas, the Contractor
			      must provide Hot Swap Warranty Service. The Contractor may
			  also substitute Hot Swap Warranty Service for any service call where the
			  Authorized User agrees in writing.</p>
			<p>		      (c) <strong>Remedial Maintenance:</strong></p>
			<p>		      (i) The Contractor must perform remedial maintenance services,
	            as and when requested by Authorized Users.</p>
			<p>(ii) 
		      When Canada requests remedial maintenance, the Contractor's
		              service representative must respond within 24 hours. Service
		              response time does not include Saturdays, Sundays or statutory
	              holidays. Response time is calculated from the time the Contractor,
	              its Authorized Agent or Service Outlet has been notified by
			      the Authorized User until the Contractor's technician arrives
			  on site, regardless of the location from which the maintenance services
		      are provided.</p>
			<p>(iii) 
		      Upon commencing maintenance services, the technician must
	                work continuously throughout the PPM until the Product
              is returned to operation in accordance with the Technical Specifications
        in Annex A and the Product Details or until notified by Canada
        to suspend the work.</p>
			<p>(iv) 
		      If, after arrival by the Contractor's technician on site, the
	                  Contractor determines that it cannot repair the Product
			      within two (2) working days, then the Contractor must provide
			  a loaner unit, similarly equipped as the Product being repaired, at
	                  no charge within 24 hours of making this determination.
			      The Authorized User must be permitted to keep the loaner unit
			  until the original Product is repaired and returned in working condition
          to the Authorized User. The Contractor must provide restoration and
              hardware-specific configuration on the loaner equipment and upon
              return of the original Product. </p>
			<p>(d) <strong> Software Support:</strong> The Licensed Software must be to the
			  latest version released, unless otherwise specified, and must be
			  provided with the standard software publisher's warranty and customer
                support. The Contractor must specify the duration and level
                of coverage of the software publisher's standard warranty (e.g.,
              one-year hotline support).</p>
			<p>(e) 
		      <strong>Maintenance Reports:</strong> For each visit to perform On-Site Warranty
          Services, a Warranty Service maintenance report must be prepared
          by the Contractor's technician. It must include the following:</p>
			<p>(i) 
		      Standing Offer and Call-up number;</p>
			<p>(ii) 
	        Authorized User's name, telephone number and location;</p>
			<p>(iii) 
		      date and time of receipt of call and which service outlet received
            the call;</p>
			<p>(iv) 
		      dispatch date and time;</p>
			<p>(v)
	        printer type and Serial Number;</p>
			<p>(vi) 
		      site arrival/departure date and time (including the number
of hours and date for each day on-site);</p>
			<p>(vii) 
	        reason for call (description of symptom/diagnosis of fault);</p>
			<p>(viii)
	        action taken/service performed, including list of parts replaced/installed;</p>
			<p>(ix)
	        technician's name and signature; and</p>
			<p>(x) 
		      name (printed) and signature of Authorized User accepting that
                          the Product appears to be working in a satisfactory
  manner.</p>
			<p>		      The Contractor must retain a copy of this report for
            a period of 6 years and must, upon request by the Contracting
        Authority, provide a copy of the report to Canada within
        30 calendar days.</p>
