			<p><strong>Annex A: Technical Specifications</strong></p>
			<p><strong>1. Mandatory General Specifications for All Printers</strong></p>
			<p>			  All printers, under all Groups, Categories and Sub-Categories must
		      meet or exceed the following Mandatory General Specifications:</p>
			<p>(a)
			  The printers must produce output from normal and complex office
			  automation applications such as word processing, spreadsheets,
			    graphics, and a combination of text and graphics on the same
		      page.</p>
			<p>(b)
			  The printers must support bilingual (English &amp; French) capabilities
			  for the full character set including upper- and lower-case accents, scientific
			  graphics, and special bit-generated characters. All printers must support
			  the bilingual (English &amp; French) capabilities of all IBM and IBM-compatible
			  microcomputer software. It is desirable that all printers also support Apple/Macintosh
			  computers.</p>
			<p>(c)
			  The printers must be fully operational in a normal office environment
			  at normal room temperature, and be capable of meeting the yield
			  volume and level of service requirements listed in these Technical
			  Specifications, in a non-dedicated operator situation, in a minimal
			  attended mode.</p>
			<p>(d)
			  A user manual must be supplied with each printer in accordance
			  with the Article in the Contract entitled &quot;User Manuals&quot;. The
			  user manual must define all functions and include complete instructions
			  for the operation of the printer and include documentation regarding power
			  and environmental or site preparation requirements; documentation for diagnostics
			  and power-on self test; software and hardware installation and configuration
			  instructions; and packaging instructions for shipping or transporting.</p>
			<p>(e)
			  All printers must operate with 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; plain paper normally
			  used in office correspondence, such as 20 pound, # 7 bond, plain offset
			  stock, or pre-printed letterhead sheets.</p>
			<p>(f)		      All printers must:</p>
			<p>(i)		      be certified as compliant with the Canadian Electrical
			  Code for office printers by an organization approved by the Standards
		      Council of Canada;</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      be certified by the manufacturer as complying with the Class
		        A or B limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus
		        set out in the Interference Causing Equipment Standard (ICES-003)
		        of Industry Canada, or US FCC Class A or B equivalent emission
		        limits for digital apparatus as set in the Radio Interference
		        Regulations;</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      be Energy Star qualified at the time of product acceptance.
		          The vendor must ship all products with the Energy Star low-power
	          feature activated or enabled. </p>
			<p>(iv)		      be manufactured in facilities that are both ISO 9001:2000
			  and ISO 14001 certified; and</p>
			<p>(v)
		      have an Environmental Ecolabeling Certification at the time
              of product acceptance. </p>
			<p>(g)		      All printers must be equipped with an alarm or indicator,
			  either hardware or software, to alert the user when the printer
			  is out of paper.</p>
			<p>(h)
		      All printers must switch from PCL to Postscript or vice versa
              without manual intervention, if PostScript is one of the emulations
              offered. The method and implementation of this switching must
              be compatible with typical network operation.</p>
			<p>(i)
		      The printers must not prevent, through specific design features
              or manufacturing processes, the use of remanufactured imaging
              consumables, except where a licensing agreement has precluded
              the remanufacture. Consumables able to be remanufactured must
              be available for the printers.</p>
