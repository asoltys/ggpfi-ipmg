			<p><strong>A.12 Call-up Process / Call-up Limitations</strong></p>
			<p>(a)			  <strong>Multiple Standing Offers:</strong> The Offeror acknowledges that
			  multiple Standing Offers have been issued for this requirement.
			  Call-ups will be allocated among the Offerors in accordance with the process
		    described below.</p>
			<p>(b)
			  <strong>Only Authorized Call-ups to be Accepted: </strong>The Offeror agrees only
			  to accept individual Call-ups made by Authorized Users pursuant
			    to this Standing Offer that do not exceed the applicable Call-up
			    Limitations outlined below. The Offeror acknowledges that any
			  Call-up made by an Authorized User exceeding the applicable Call-up Limitation
		      is not permitted under this Standing Offer and without authority.</p>
			<p>(c)
			  <strong>Call-ups only to be Accepted by Active Offerors:</strong> The Offeror
			    agrees only to accept Call-ups for printers during periods in
			    which it has been identified by the Contracting Authority as
			  an &quot;Active Offeror&quot; for
			  that particular Sub-Category , unless contacted directly the Contracting
			  Authority.</p>
			<p>(d)<strong> Call-ups may be directed to Agents</strong>: Call-ups may be addressed
			      to the Offeror directly or to the Offeror care of any of its
			  Authorized Agents.</p>
			<p>(e)
		      <strong>Contracting Authority: </strong>PWGSC will act as the Contracting Authority
			      for all Call-ups, including those made directly by Authorized
		      Users.</p>
			<p>(f)
		      <strong>Division and Consolidation of Requirements: </strong>Multiple Call-ups
		        will not be issued in order to circumvent competition. The
		        Contracting Authority may consolidate requirements across Authorized
		        Users and issue Call-ups on a periodic basis to receive best
		        tier or better pricing on the Products.</p>
			<p>(g)

		          directly to any Offeror (or the Offeror's Authorized Agent)
			      in the applicable Sub-Category, up to the applicable Call-up
			  Limitation specified below, in accordance with the following:</p>
			<p>(i)
		      For Call-ups of consumables only: the Authorized User may place
	            Call-ups (valued at up to $25,000) that consist only of consumables,
	            from any of the Offerors (both Active and Inactive). Any Call-ups
	            of consumables exceeding $25,000 must be issued by the Contracting
	            Authority.</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      For Call-ups of Optional Items only: the Authorized User may
	              place Call-ups (valued at up to $25,000) that consist of Optional
	              Items only from any of the Offerors (both Active and Inactive).
	              Any Call-ups of Optional Items exceeding $25,000 must be issued
              by the Contracting Authority.</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      For Call-ups from Group 1 Sub-Categories (which may include,
              within the Call-up Limitation, additional consumables and Optional
              Items):</p>
			<p>(A)
		      <strong>Up to $25,000</strong> (GST/HST included): the Authorized User may place
              the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product(s), in the
              Authorized User's view, represents the best value;</p>
			<p>(B)
		      <strong>Up to $400,000</strong> (GST/HST included): the Authorized User may
              place the Call-up with the Active Offeror with the Product
              with the best Value Factor in the appropriate order-size tier
              in the Sub-Category on the date of the Call-up, if the Product
              meets the technical and compatibility requirements of the Authorized
              User;</p>
			<p>		      If an Authorized User wishes to issue a call-up to a single
              supplier for a requirement consisting of multiple Sub-categories
              within Category 1, or Category 2, respectively, the Authorized
              User may place the Call-up with the Active Offeror offering
              the products with the best aggregate Value Factor in the appropriate
              order-size tier across the required Sub-categories, providing
              the aggregate Value Factor falls within 10% of the aggregation
              of the best value products from multiple suppliers.</p>
			<p>(C)<strong>From $400,000 up to $10,000,000</strong> (GST/HST included): only the Contracting
			  Authority may place Call-ups of this value. The Contracting Authority

			  with the best Value Factor on the date of the Call-up for the required
			  configuration in the appropriate order-size tier, if the Product
			  meets the technical and compatibility requirements of the Authorized
		    User. </p>
			<p>		      The Contracting Authority reserves the right to negotiate the
			      prices for Call-ups over $400,000 and, where the Contracting Authority
			      determines that the available prices do not represent good value, the
			      Contracting Authority may use other methods of supply to fulfill the
		        requirement. </p>

			      within the Call-up Limitation, additional consumables and Optional
		      Items):</p>
			<p>(A)<strong> Up to $25,000</strong> (GST/HST included): the Authorized User may place
		        the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product(s), in the
		        Authorized User's view, represents the best value;</p>
			<p>(B)
		      <strong>Up to $200,000</strong> (GST/HST included): the Authorized User may
		          place the Call-up with the Active Offeror with the Product
			      with the best Value Factor in the appropriate order-size tier
			  in the Sub-Category on the date of the Call-up, if the Product meets
		          the technical and compatibility requirements of the Authorized
		      User. </p>
			<p>(C)
		      <strong>From $200,000 up to $10,000,000</strong> (GST/HST included): only the

	            Offeror with the Product with the best Value Factor on the
	            date of the Call-up for the required configuration in the appropriate
	            order-size tier, if the Product meets the technical and compatibility
	            requirements of the Authorized User. </p>
			<p>The Contracting Authority reserves the right to negotiate the prices for
			  Call-ups over $200,000 and, where the Contracting Authority determines that
			  the available prices do not represent good value, the Contracting Authority
			  may the Contracting Authority may use other methods of supply to fulfill
			  the requirement.</p>

			  must:</p>
			<p>(i)
		      inform the Authorized User of the installation charges set out
			    in the Best Value Grid on the IPMG website that apply if on-site
		        installation and configuration are requested;</p>
			<p>(ii)
		      provide the Authorized User with any wiring specifications or

		      User;</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      determine the language requirements of the Authorized User
		        for the user manuals to be delivered with the Products; and</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      determine whether receipt of the user manuals on CD-ROM or
		          downloadable from the Internet is acceptable (instead of delivery
		          of hard copies)</p>
			<p>(i)<strong>Requirements of $25,000 or more (GST/HST included)
			    that Cannot be Satisfied by Active Offeror with the printer with the highest
			    rating in the Best Value Grid:</strong> Where the Contracting Authority is satisfied that
			  the Active Offeror with the printer with the best Value Factor
			  cannot satisfy an Authorized User's requirement in any Sub-Category because
		    that Offeror:</p>
			<p>(i)
		      cannot supply all the Products required by the Authorized User
		      by the Delivery Date specified in the Resulting Contract clauses; </p>
			<p>(ii)
		      does not have a printer listed in the Best Value Grid on the
		        IPMG website that meets all the legitimate operational requirements
		        of the Authorized User; </p>
			<p>(iii)
		      has failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement;
	          or</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      has already defaulted on a Call-up issued by the Authorized
	            User for the required Products,</p>
			<p>		      then the Contracting Authority may place a Call-up (or provide
	              written permission to the Authorised User to place a Call-up)
              with the next highest Active Offeror.</p>
			<p>(j)
		      <strong>Requirements that Cannot be Satisfied by Active
		      Offerors: </strong>Where
              the Contracting Authority is satisfied that the none of Active
              Offerors can satisfy an Authorized User's requirement in any
              Sub-Category because the Active Offerors:</p>
			<p>(i)		      cannot supply all the Products required by the Authorized
			  User by the Delivery Date specified in the Resulting Contract clauses; </p>
			<p>(ii)
		      do not have a printer listed in the Best Value Grid on the
              IPMG website that meets all the legitimate operational requirements
              of the Authorized User;</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      have all failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement;
              or</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      have defaulted on Call-ups for the Products currently required
              by the Authorized User,</p>
			<p>		      then the Contracting Authority may place a Call-up with one
              of the other Offerors in the relevant Sub-Category that can
              satisfy these requirements, at the unit price(s) that Offeror
              offered during the most recent downward price revision or the
              Contracting Authority may use other sourcing methods to procure
              the Products. Only the Contracting Authority can place Call-ups
              with Offerors other than the Active Offerors. The Offeror agrees
              not to accept any Call-ups, except from the Contracting Authority,
              while it is not an Active Offeror.</p>
			<p>(k)
		      <strong>Authority of Authorized Users to Place Direct Call-ups
		      may be Withdrawn: </strong>The Contracting Authority may, at any time, provide
              the Offerors with 30 days' written notice that the authority
              of an Authorized User to place direct Call-ups has been withdrawn.
              In this case, only the Contracting Authority may make Call-ups
              on behalf of that Authorized User and the Offeror agrees not
              to fulfill any Call-ups made directly by that Authorized User.</p>
