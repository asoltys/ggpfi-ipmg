			<p><strong>Financial, Liability and Insurance</strong></p>
			<p><strong> B.15 Invoicing and Payment</strong></p>
			<p>		      (a) <strong>Payment for Products:</strong> For the supply, delivery (FOB destination)
			      and configuration of the Products identified in the Call-up,
			        the ancillary equipment, required software, user manuals,
			      and one-year on-site Warranty Services, the Contractor will
			  be paid the firm unit price in the Best Value Grid on the IPMG
			  website on the date of the Call-up for the appropriate tier (based
		    on the volume of Products ordered).</p>
			<p>(b) <strong> Payment for Upgrade to Warranty Service:</strong> For the provision
			          of an upgrade of the one-year on-site Warranty Services,
			      the Contractor will be paid the price on the Best Value Grid
			  on the IPMG website on the date of the Call-up.</p>
			<p>(c) <strong> Payment for Installation of Printers:</strong> For the installation
        of printers (if requested in the Call-up), the Contractor will
	            be paid the firm installation prices set out in the Best Value
			      Grid on the IPMG website on the date of the Call-up. This price
			  includes all travel, labour, parts, other materials and all other
			  related costs for the provision of installation service at locations
			      anywhere in Canada within a radius of 100 km of any city or
		    town with a population of at least 30,000 (except CLCA areas).</p>
			<p>(d) <strong> Payment for Installation of Optional Items: </strong>An installation
		            price for Optional Items may be charged if set out in the
			      Best Value Grid on the IPMG website, but only if the Optional
			  Item is ordered and installed on-site after the original delivery
			      of the printer (that is, the installation price for a printer
	              includes the installation any associated Optional Items, except
	              where that Optional Item is ordered separately and installed
	        later).</p>
			<p>(e) <strong> Payment for Consumables</strong>: For Consumables, the Contractor will
            be paid the firm prices set out in the Best Value Grid on the
            IPMG website on the date of the Call-up. </p>
			<p>(f) <strong> Negotiated Prices:</strong> If the Call-up was issued by the Contracting
	                Authority, all prices will be as negotiated by the Contracting
	                Authority. Any additional or revised terms and conditions
	        will form part of any negotiated Call-up.</p>
			<p>(g) 		      <strong>Taxes and Surcharges:</strong></p>
			
			<p>(i) <strong>GST/HST: </strong>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)
			  are extra. GST/HST, to the extent applicable, must be incorporated
			  into all invoices and progress claims and will be paid by Canada.
			  GST/HST must be shown as a separate item on invoices and progress claims.
			  All items that are zero-rated, exempt, or to which the GST/HST does not
			  apply must be identified as such on all invoices. The Contractor agrees
		    to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any GST/HST paid or due. </p>
			<p>(ii) <strong> Provincial Sales Tax: </strong>The prices do not include provincial
                  sales tax. If a provincial sales tax license number or a
			      signed Certificate of Exemption is not provided in a Call-up,
			  the provincial sales tax, if applicable, may be added to the
			      invoice by the Contractor as a separate item and will be paid
			  by Canada (unless Canada provides the provincial sales tax license
	        number or a signed Certificate of Exemption with its payment).</p>
			<p>(iii) <strong> Alberta Advance Disposal Surcharge:</strong> If the Product
			  is delivered to a location in Alberta, all unit prices are exclusive of
        the Alberta Advance Disposal Surcharge (ADS), unless otherwise
        indicated. The ADS is extra to the price and will be paid by
        Canada. If the province where the printer is delivered has
        a program similar to the one that has been put into place in
        the province of Alberta, the applicable surcharge will be extra
        to the prices and amounts in the Standing Offer and will be paid
        by Canada. </p>
			<p>(h) <strong> Invoicing:</strong> Invoices may be issued by the Contractor or
			  its Authorized Agent. The invoice must be in the Contractor's
			      or its Authorized Agent's own form and must be in accordance
			  with Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403-6, Part C (Conditions),
                  section 4. The Contractor must send the invoice to the Authorized
                  User in accordance with any instructions detailed in the
			      Call-up and must not submit an invoice before delivery of the
			  Products to which it relates. Any invoices where items or group
			  of items cannot be easily identified will be sent back to the
			  Contractor for clarification with no interest or late payment charges
            applicable to Canada.</p>
			<p>(i) <strong> Payment: </strong>Canada will pay the Contractor within thirty (30)
        days following the Acceptance Date or thirty (30) days following
        the date on which an invoice and substantiating documentation
        are received according to the terms of this Contract, whichever
        is later. If Canada disputes an invoice for any reason, Canada
        will pay the Contractor the undisputed portion of the invoice,
        as long as the undisputed items are separate line items on
        the invoice and are otherwise due and payable. In the case of
        disputed invoices, the invoice will only be deemed to have been
        received for the purposes of Section 15 of General Conditions
        9601 (Interest on Overdue Accounts) once the dispute is resolved.</p>
			<p>(j) <strong> Payments Directed to Authorized Agent: </strong>If this Contract
			  is being performed by an Authorized Agent on behalf of the Contractor,
                  Canada is entitled to forward payment either to the Contractor
                  or to its Authorized Agent that performed the work. Receipt
                  by the Authorized Agent of payment will be deemed to be receipt
            by the Contractor of such payment.</p>
			<p>(k) <strong> Credit Card Payment: </strong>The Contractor will not add any surcharge
    for payment by credit card.</p>
