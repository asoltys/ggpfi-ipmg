			<p><strong>B.11 Warranty Services</strong></p>
			<p>			  In addition to and notwithstanding Section 8.0 (Warranty) in Supplemental
			    General Conditions 9601-1 and Section 13.0 (Warranty) in Supplemental
			    General Conditions 9601-4, the Contractor agrees to provide the
		    following Warranty Services:</p>
			<p>(a) <strong> Warranty Period:</strong> The Warranty Period under this Contract
			  is 12 months, unless the Authorized User purchases an upgrade
			  to the standard warranty (either at the time of purchase of the
			  Product or at any time before the expiry of the initial one-year
			  on-site warranty).</p>
			<p>(b) <strong> Beginning of Warranty Period: </strong>The Warranty Period begins on the
			  Acceptance Date for each Product (and, therefore, the Warranty
			  Period may begin on different dates for different Products under
			    this Contract, if they were delivered and/or accepted on different
		    dates).</p>
			<p>(c) <strong> Warranty Services:</strong> The warranty services to be provided by the
			  Contractor include On-Site Warranty Maintenance and Warranty Technical
		    Support as described in this Contract (collectively, the &quot;Warranty Services&quot;).</p>
			<p>(d) <strong> Parts: </strong>The Contractor guarantees that all parts and technical
			      materials required to provide the Warranty Services will be
			  available for 4 years from the date of the Call-up. All parts supplied by
			  the Contractor in performing any maintenance services must be new,
		      unused or certified equal quality.</p>
			<p>(e) <strong> Warranty Service Calls: </strong>Authorized Users may contact:</p>
			<p>(i) 
		      any service outlet identified by the Contractor at the telephone
			        number on the IPMG website (which must accept service calls
			      from all Authorized Users, anywhere in Canada, during the hours
			      of 08:00 to 17:00 in the local time where the service outlet
			  is located, Monday through Friday, excluding statutory holidays);
		      or</p>
			<p>(ii) 
		      the Offeror's single toll-free Maintenance Dispatch Number
	          (which must accept service calls from all Authorized Users, anywhere
	          in Canada, during the hours of 08:00 to 17:00 across all time
	          zones across Canada, Monday through Friday, excluding statutory
	        holidays).</p>
			<p>(f) 
		      <strong>Warranty Services included in Product Price:</strong> The cost of all
		            parts, labour, travel and any other related costs associated
		            with the Warranty Services are included in the unit price
			      of the Products and no payments will be made for the Warranty
		          Services, regardless of the location from which the Warranty
	        Services are provided.</p>
			<p>(g) <strong> Hot Swap Service:</strong> If agreed upon by the Authorized User, Hot
            Swap Warranty Service may be provided instead of on-site Warranty
            Service, either on a per-service-call basis or throughout the
            Warranty Period. In the latter case, the Authorized User must
            have approved this at the time of the Call-up, in writing. Where
            a Warranty Service call is made that cannot be resolved by telephone
            and Hot Swap Service applies, the Offeror must, within 24 hours,
            send to the Authorized User, postage paid, a replacement Product
            that is substantially equal to the Product being replaced, in
	            that it is of similar age or better and able to perform all functions
            of the Product being replaced. Upon receipt of the replacement
	            Product, the Authorized User will return the defective Product
			      to the Offeror or manufacturer, as applicable, in appropriate
			  packaging with the shipping paid by the Offeror. If the Authorized User
			      is not satisfied that the replacement Product is substantially
			  equal, the Contractor must supply another replacement. The Contractor
			      must continue to provide the Warranty Services for the replacement
		    Product.</p>
			<p>(h)<strong> Change in Authorized User:</strong> The Contractor's obligation to provide
	                the Warranty Services will not be affected by any change
	        in the Authorized User of the Product(s).</p>
			<p>(i) 
		      <strong>Escalation Plan:</strong> The Contractor's escalation plan with
		      respect to Warranty Services is as follows: ____________________________.</p>
