            <p><strong>Environmental Programs</strong></p>
            <p>The Environmental Programs required for printers offered under
              this series of NMSOs are excerpted from Annex A and the programs
              required of their Offerors are described in Annex B.</p>
            <p><strong>Annex A: Technical Specifications</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Mandatory General Specifications for All Printers<br>
            </strong>              All printers, under all Groups, Categories and Sub-Categories must
                meet or exceed the following Mandatory General Specifications:</p>
            <p>(f) All printers must:</p>
            <p>              (i) be certified as compliant with the Canadian Electrical Code
                for office printers by an organization approved by the Standards
              Council of Canada;</p>
            <p>              (ii) be certified by the manufacturer as complying with the Class
            A or B limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus
            set out in the Interference Causing Equipment Standard (ICES-003)
            of Industry Canada, or US FCC Class A or B equivalent emission
            limits for digital apparatus as set in the Radio Interference Regulations;</p>
            <p>              (iii) be Energy Star qualified at the time of product acceptance.
              The vendor must ship all products with the Energy Star low-power
              feature activated or enabled.</p>
            <p>              (iv) be manufactured in facilities that are both ISO 9001:2000
              and ISO 14001 certified; and</p>
            <p>              (v) have an Environmental Ecolabeling Certification at the time
              of product acceptance. </p>
            <p>(i) The printers must not prevent, through specific design features
              or manufacturing processes, the use of remanufactured imaging consumables,
              except where a licensing agreement has precluded the remanufacture.
              Consumables able to be remanufactured must be available for the
            printers.</p>
            <p>In addition, 
              all printers in all sub-categories must be configured to print
                double-sided (duplex) documents as their default.</p>
            <p><strong>Annex B: Environmental Requirements</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Consumables Containers Recycling Program</strong> <br>
              For all locations in Canada (except CLCA areas) where consumables
                containers cannot be recycled through local &quot;blue-box&quot; recycling
                programs, the Contractor must provide its own consumables recycling
              program by either:</p>
            <p>              providing prepaid, postage-return packaging with the consumable
              when it is originally delivered, or available for download from
              the manufacturer's website; OR</p>
            <p>              picking up used consumables containers at no charge.</p>
            <p>              (b) Where consumables are purchased through subsequent standing
              offers or other purchasing instruments with provisions for Empty
              Cartridge Return Credit, this credit will be payable to Canada
              and procedures for return and pick up will be in accordance with
              the provisions of those standing offers.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Hardware Take-Back and Recycling Program<br>
            </strong>              The Contractor must control electronic waste through the establishment
              of an ongoing hardware take-back and recycling program. </p>
            <p>              For a period of six (6) years from the date of the Call-up issuance,
              the Contractor must take back (whether or not the equipment remains
              in government control) any products supplied under any Call-ups
              (even if the Warranty Period is complete), if requested by the
              end user, at no charge, but is not required to pay for shipping
              and handling.</p>
            <p>              The Contractor must recycle or dispose of all equipment taken back
              in an environmentally sensitive manner. At a minimum, the recycling
              of equipment should involve material recovery and metals recovery
              processes.&nbsp; Facilities used to process end of life electronics
              must meet all applicable health, safety, environment, transport
              and export regulations. Facilities must possess all required permits
              and appropriate insurance.</p>
            <p>              Acceptable processes include manual dismantling and sorting into
              major material categories (non-hazardous materials, electronic
              scrap materials, and hazardous materials) and mechanical processing
              for dismantling and/or material separation, with provision of
              dust collection and operator risk assessments and protection.</p>
            <p><strong>              Major Material categories are defined as follows:</strong></p>
            <p> 1) Non-Hazardous Materials include ferrous metal, non-ferrous
                metal, other metals (brass, bronze, metal fines), plastics, wood,
              and glass (non-leaded).</p>
            <p>              2) Electronic Scrap Materials include cables and wires, printed
              circuit boards (high, medium and low grade), components, including
              hard drives, chips and other electronic components.</p>
            <p>              3) Hazardous Materials include cathode ray tubes (CRT), CRT frit,
              leaded plasma display glass and other leaded glass, rechargeable
              batteries, non-rechargeable batteries, including alkaline, lead
              acid, and coin cell batteries on circuit boards, mercury bearing
              lamps and switches, components containing polychlorinated biphenyls,
              Ink and toner cartridges.</p>
            <p>              Electronic scrap materials and hazardous materials:</p>
            <p>              - may not be landfilled, exported to non-OECD or non-EU member
              countries, or processed with the use of prison labour.</p>
            <p>              - exporting of these materials must be done in compliance to
              the Export and Import of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable
              Material Regulation (EIHWHRMR).</p>
            <p>              In the event that it is determined by Canada that an Offeror
              is refusing to take back product or not recycling that product
              in accordance with the minimum requirements of the standing offer,
              Canada will arrange to have the subject material recovered and
              disposed off appropriately at the cost of the Offeror. In addition,
              the Offeror will have their standing offer deauthorized and will
              be excluded from holding a similar standing offer with Canada
              for a minimum of one year from the date of determination.</p>
            <p><strong>              3. Packaging Take-Back and Recycling</strong></p>
            <p>(a) All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped
              must be recyclable. </p>
            <p>(b) The Contractor must reuse, recycle or dispose of all packaging
              materials removed from Products delivered under any Call-up in
              an environmentally sensitive manner.</p>
