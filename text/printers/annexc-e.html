            <p><b>National Master Standing Offer</b> <br>
                <b>EZ107-060001/001/VAN to EZ107-060001/006/VAN</b> <br>
                <b>Desktop and Network Printers &nbsp;</b> including Accessories, Supplies and Services</p>
				
			<p><strong>Annex C: Benchmark Testing</strong></p>
			<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
			<p>		      Benchmark tests on offered equipment are mandatory and must be
			      conducted as part of the evaluation. The Benchmark tests must
			      be conducted by the testing authority, NSTL Canada Corp. (NSTL), at
			      the NSTL test site located in the National Capital Area. The benchmark
			      procedures have been established in cooperation with NSTL. All questions
			      and concerns about these procedures must be addressed to the Contracting
			      Authority. Failure to comply with the benchmark test procedures may
		        result in disqualification of an Offer without further notice.</p>
			<p><strong>		      2. Nature of Testing</strong></p>
			<p>		      The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation,
		        unless the benchmark testing reveals that a printer does not
		          meet a mandatory requirement of the solicitation. It is used
			      to generate a score based on the performance (speed), quality
			      of output, features and usability of the printer. This score is used
			      in the determination of Value Factor. The data generated through the
			      benchmark testing will be used for evaluation and posted on the IPMG
		        site.</p>
			<p><strong>		      3. Benchmark Test Schedule</strong></p>
			<p>		      Canada will submit a list of products to be benchmarked to
		          NSTL. NSTL, in cooperation with the PWGSC Contracting Authority,
	              will then draw up the Benchmark Test Schedule. Offerors will
		          be notified by e-mail and/or facsimile of the Benchmark Test
			      Schedule, at least seven (7) calendar days in advance. The
			      notification will include the schedule of delivery dates for each Product
			      to be tested, and detailed instructions regarding delivery of test units,
			      supplies, documents and payments required for the benchmark tests. Failure
			      to deliver the equipment and other items on the specified date(s) and
			      time will result in disqualification if NSTL, in its sole discretion,
			      determines that extending the deadline will have an impact on the overall
		        testing schedule.</p>
			<p><strong>		      4. Use of Previous Test Data for Evaluation of this RFSO</strong></p>
			<p>		      If a printer offered under this RFSO has previously been tested
            by NSTL for other requirements (including the NMSO#EZ107-060001/001/VAN to EZ107-060001/006/VAN030001/XXX/VIC
            series of Offers), any resulting test data may be used if NSTL
            determines that the data applies to this requirement. Decisions
            by NSTL will be final in this respect. Although an administration
              fee will be required to cover the costs of recompiling and
		          posting the data for the new requirement, this fee will not
			      exceed the benchmark test fee identified below for the relevant Sub-Category.
	              It is the Offeror's responsibility (at the time testing is
		          scheduled with NSTL) to indicate where a printer has already
			      been tested by NSTL so that the previous test data can be verified
		      and testing for any missing data can be scheduled.</p>
			<p><strong>		      5. Equipment Delivered for Testing</strong></p>
			<p>		      (a) Equipment delivered for testing should be accompanied by:</p>
			<p>(i)		      full payment for all tests;</p>
			<p>(ii) 		      the completed NSTL Features Questionnaire (available through
              the Internet before the test period begins);</p>
			<p>(iii)
		      a qualified technician to set up and configure the equipment;
and</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      a complete set of the user manuals normally provided by the
	                            Offeror or the OEM, in both English and French
  (or bilingual), both for verification and for use during the testing. </p>
			<p>(b)		      Each printer should be delivered with a 10' cable for
          the Centronics parallel interface. Printers that have both
          a USB and a parallel interface should be delivered with
          USB and parallel cables. USB-only devices must incorporate
          a USB port and include a USB cable. </p>
			<p>(c)
		      The Offeror should also supply two (2) sets of appropriate
              imaging consumables (not including paper).</p>
			<p>(d) 
		      Printers submitted into network categories should include
a card and cable for Ethernet 10/100 or 100 Base T.</p>
			<p>(e)
		      Any Products delivered without all of the above may not be
                        tested by NSTL, in which case they will be disqualified
    as non-compliant.</p>
			<p>(f)
		      Each Product supplied for benchmark testing must meet or
        exceed the Technical Specifications in Annex A and the Product
        Details and must be identical to the Product described in
        the Offer.</p>
			<p><strong>		      6. Installation and Configuration for Benchmark Testing</strong></p>
			<p>		      (a) It is the Offeror's responsibility to install, set up and
			  test the equipment at the NSTL testing site before benchmark
          testing.</p>
			<p>(b)
		      It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that equipment
      is delivered to the Benchmark test site on the appointed date
      by 2PM EST.</p>
			<p>(c)
		      Offerors setting up more than 1 machine are expected to bring
                            sufficient staff to complete all set-ups according
        to the following guidelines:</p>
			<p>(i) 		      4 hours for up to 8 machines;</p>
			<p>(ii)		      8 hours for up to 16 machines; and</p>
			<p>(iii) 
		      12 hours for over 16 machines. </p>
			<p>(d)		      Failure to set up the Products within these time frames
			  will result in disqualification if NSTL, in its sole discretion,
                  determines that extending the deadline will have an impact
              on the overall testing schedule.</p>
			<p><strong>		      7. Inadequate or Malfunctioning Equipment</strong></p>
			<p>		      (a) If the equipment set up for benchmark testing does not
			  function in compliance with the Technical Specifications in Annex
A and/or the technical specifications described in the Offer,
    or is found to be different from the printer described
in the Offer, it will be removed, and a new appointment will
be made to deliver an operational and/or compliant printer within
2 working days.</p>
			<p>		      (b) If a printer is unable to complete benchmark tasks with
			  the offered memory and additional memory is required,
  the Offeror will be given an opportunity to increase the memory for
            further benchmark testing within 2 working days. If the printer
			      completes benchmark testing with the increased memory, the
  Offeror must furnish this added memory for all Call-ups for the printer
                            without increasing the price (if it is listed in
  a resulting Standing Offer) or withdraw the printer from consideration.</p>
			<p>(c) 		      If, at the end of this 2-working-day period:</p>
			<p>(i)		      the equipment or its replacement exhibits the same
              fault a second time;</p>
			<p>(ii) 
		      the equipment or its replacement exhibits another fault; </p>
			<p>(iii)
		      the addition of memory does not allow the printer to function
        in accordance with the Technical Specifications; or</p>
			<p>(iv)
		      the Offeror has failed to make the repair or submit the replacement
                or additional memory, the equipment will be eliminated from further
			  consideration in all relevant Sub-Categories.</p>
			<p>(d)		      Upon request, NSTL will demonstrate any fault found during
                      the benchmark tests.</p>
			<p><strong>		      8. Return of Equipment after Testing</strong></p>
			<p>		      Equipment provided for testing may
              be required for up to 60 working days.
              After the Product has been tested,
              NSTL will contact the Offeror with
              a date and time for retrieving the
              Product from the test site. The Offeror
              must retrieve the Product from NSTL
              within an hour of the appointed date
and time. Offerors are strongly advised to inform
NSTL as soon as they become aware that they might
not be able to make an appointment to deliver or
retrieve printers.</p>
			<p><strong>		      9. Contact Information</strong></p>
			<p>		      Offerors may contact the following NSTL contact (collocated
                                      at PWGSC) for any matters concerning

			<p><strong>		      10. Benchmark test fees</strong></p>
			<p>		      Benchmark tests must be conducted by NSTL Canada Corp.
                      NSTL is not part of the Government of Canada. The Offeror
                      may be required to enter into an agreement with NSTL
		              regarding the testing. All costs associated with the benchmark
			          testing are the Offeror's responsibility. The cost for
			      benchmark testing each printer will be in accordance with the Schedule
                      of Benchmark Costs identified below, and is payable by
                      certified cheque made out to NSTL. The fees below will
                      apply during initial evaluation, but may be subject to
                      change during the Standing Offer Period. The fees below
                  include GST.</p>
			<p>		      A certified cheque in the amount required must be delivered
to NSTL before benchmark testing commences. Offerors
submitting more than one printer may present one cheque
for all printers or one cheque for each group of printers submitted
