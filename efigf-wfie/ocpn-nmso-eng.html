Sales outlets are defined as providing representation, through either employees, or agents, in the applicable region, familiar with the terms and conditions of the National Master Standing Offer as well as with the Offeror's pricing and the technical details of the offered scanners, and able to communicate this information to Identified Users. The main deliverable required from a Sales outlet is the ability to assist an Identified User, if requested, with the determination their requirement; with the interpretation of product information, and with the placement of the subsequent call-up, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Sales outlets may be asked to provide pre-sales assistance on-site and this option is to be available to the client should the need arise and the specific requirement warrants such service.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Outlets and Service Outlets: </strong>A single outlet may provide both sales and service.

<h4>11A.1	Compliance</h4>
  <p>Compliance with the certifications provided by the Offeror is a condition of authorization of the Standing Offer and subject to verification by Canada during the term of the Standing Offer and of any resulting contract that would continue beyond the period of the Standing Offer. In the event that the Offeror does not comply with any certification or it is determined that any certification made by the Offeror in its offer is untrue, whether made knowingly or unknowingly, Canada has the right to terminate any resulting contract for default and set aside the Standing Offer.</p>

<h3 id="o13a">13A. Downward Price Revision</h3>
<p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> will allow all Offerors (both Inactive and Active) in each Sub-Category to reduce their pricing voluntarily every two months. Written notification of requested changes must be received by the Contracting Authority a minimum of five (5) working days prior to the last day of the two-month period and the Value Factor will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Canada reserves the right to revise this time period if necessary.</p>
<p>During the Standing Offer Period, <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> reserves the right to specify an alternative downward price revision process at their sole discretion. Offerors will be given sufficient notification of any changes to the downward price revision process.</p>
<h4>13A.1&nbsp;	Promotional Pricing</h4>
<p>Promotional pricing may be offered for all listed products and is defined as temporary pricing that is put in place for two months at a time without lowering the ceiling price of the item. Promotional pricing must be requested at the time of submission of downward price revisions, but will be applied only for Offerors that have been identified as Active Offerors for that two-month period in accordance with 14&nbsp;&quot;Identification of Active Offerors&quot;. Offerors may choose to both request a reduction of their ceiling price in order to increase the likelihood  that they will remain Active (and therefore able to post their sale pricing) and request a Promotional Price, concurrently. Promotional pricing must be in the form of price reductions only.</p>
<p>Promotional prices on products, on the upgrade of the warranty service from one year to four years, and on the installation, will impact the order of selection for the Call-up Limitations, but will not displace vendors who had been accepted as Active Offerors for the two-month period before the application of the Promotional Pricing.</p>
<p>Promotional prices on optional equipment are permissible.</p>

These Offerors are referred to as the &quot;Active Offerors&quot;, as only their Products will be available to Identified Users for Call-ups during the two-month period. For this two-month period, the new Active Offerors and their prices will be posted in the Best Value Grid for use on the first British Columbian business day of the two-month period following receipt of the price revision request.</p>

<h3 id="c3b">3B. Term of Contract</h3>
<h4>3B.1&nbsp;Compatibility Sub-Test</h4>
  <p>For any Call-up of five (5) Products or more, an Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority may specify in the Call-up that the Offeror provide a Product in the configuration(s) required for a compatibility sub-test, prior to delivery of the products, to determine whether the ordered Product(s) will meet the Identified User's compatibility requirements. To complete these tests, the Offeror must deliver and set up, (at any location designated by Canada, as long as it is within a radius of 100&nbsp;<acronym title="kilometre">km</acronym> of any city or town with a population of at least 30,000, except <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claims Agreement">CLCA</acronym> areas) within 3&nbsp;working days, up to two (2) of the product(s) for testing.  Product(s) provided for compatibility sub- testing will be delivered and set up at no additional cost to the Identified User. </p>
<p>The products delivered for testing must:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>be configured in accordance with the Identified Users actual requirements;</li>
<li>be loaded with all necessary drivers; and</li>
<li>be compatible with the specific hardware, network or software requirements identified by the Identified User or the Standing Offer Authority at the time notice of testing is given to the Offeror.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the testing indicates that some upgrades/changes (for example, to the drivers or firmware) are required, Canada will work with the Offeror to resolve these issues, provided they are reasonable within a reasonable period. If testing demonstrates that a Product is not compatible with the Identified User's particular environment, the Call-up may be cancelled in its entirety and the next highest Active Offeror will be considered, for the purposes of the Call-up Limitations, to have the Product with the best Value Factor.</p>
<p>If the test unit provided is new and is to be delivered to the end-user's location, and if it is agreed upon with the Identified User, the test unit may be considered as the first unit of the subsequent delivery. Once compatibility is assured, arrangements will be made for delivery of the rest of the order.</p>
<h4>3B.2	Delivery of Products</h4>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>___________________ (the &quot;<strong>Contractor</strong>&quot;) agrees to supply, deliver, configure, install (if requested),  and provide documentation and Warranty Services for the Products listed in the Call-up, to the Identified User by the Delivery Date, in accordance with the terms and conditions and at the price set out in this Contract.

Costs associated with replacement of Products damaged in transit to the final destination are the Contractor's responsibility, and the Products will not be considered delivered on the Delivery Date unless the Products are undamaged and ready for acceptance. The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing packaging recycling program as per the following:</p>
<ol class="decimal double-space">
<li>All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped must be recyclable.</li>

<h4>3B.10	Discounts for Late Deliveries &amp; Reimbursement of Reprocurement Costs</h4>

<li>If the Contractor is late in delivering only part of the Products ordered on a Call-up, and Canada does not terminate the Call-up for default and instead provides the Contractor with additional time to make balance of the delivery, the Contractor agrees to reduce the price of the Products delivered late by 15%, up to a maximum of 5% of the total value of the Call-up.</li>
<li>These discounts constitute liquidated damages and the Parties agree that these amounts are their best pre-estimate of the loss to Canada in the event of the defaults described, and that they are not a penalty.</li>
<li>If this Contract is terminated by Canada for default, the Contractor must reimburse Canada for any difference in cost between the price of the Products and the cost of procuring the Products from another supplier.</li>

<p>The Offeror (or its Original Equipment Manufacturer) must be registered under <acronym title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</acronym> 14001&nbsp;from a nationally accredited registrar under the <acronym title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</acronym> 14001&nbsp;Program for the manufacturing facility where the Wide Format Imaging Equipment being offered as part of this Standing Offer are manufactured.  (Reference Annex A A1, Mandatory General Specifications for all Products.)</p>
<h4>A3.2	Consumables Container Recycling Program</h4>
<p>The Offeror must currently promote recycling through an established and ongoing consumables container recycling program as per the following:</p>
<p>For all locations in Canada covered by this <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> where consumables containers cannot be recycled through local &quot;blue-box&quot; recycling programs, the Offeror must provide its own consumables recycling program by either:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>providing prepaid, postage-return packaging with the consumable when it is originally delivered, or available for download from the manufacturer's website; OR</li>
<li>picking up used consumables containers at no charge.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Reference Annex A A1, Mandatory General Specifications for all Products.)</p>
<h4>A3.3	 Packaging Recycling</h4>

<h2 id="annexe-annex-c">Annex C &ndash; Call-up Limitations</h2>
<p>An Identified User may issue a Call-up directly to any Offeror or <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> Authorized Agent in the applicable category, up to the applicable Call-up Limitation specified below, in accordance with the following:</p>
<h3>C.1	For Call-ups for Products</h3>
<p>(which may include, within the Call-up Limitation, Additional Items)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Up to&nbsp;$25,000.00</strong> (Including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): the Identified User may place the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product, in the Identified User's view, represents the best value for their requirement;</li>
<li><strong>From&nbsp;$25,000.01&nbsp;to&nbsp;$40,000.00</strong> (including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): the Identified User must place the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product is listed as the Best Value in that Sub-Category <strong>or</strong> with an Active Offeror whose Product's Value Factor is within 5% of the Best Value;</li>
<li><strong>From&nbsp;$40,000.01&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$150,000.00</strong> (including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): the Identified User must place the Call-up with the Active Offeror whose Product has the Best Value in that Category;</li>
<li><strong>From&nbsp;$150,000.01&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$2,000,000.00</strong> (including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): only the Standing Offer Authority may place Call-ups. Requirements from&nbsp;$150,000.0&nbsp;and up to&nbsp;$2,000,000.00&nbsp;may be sent to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> in a funded requisition for processing in accordance to the Request for Volume Discount (RVD) procedures as detailed in the Annex &quot;D&quot; entitled &quot;Request for Volume Discount (RVD) Procedures&quot;.<br /><br />
The Standing Offer Authority reserves the right to negotiate the prices for Call-ups over&nbsp;$150,000.00&nbsp;where <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> procedures are not appropriate because only one Offeror's Product is capable of meeting the legitimate technical requirements of the Identified User and where the Standing Offer Authority determines that the available prices do not represent good value considering the volume. The Standing Offer Authority may choose to use other methods of supply to fulfill the requirement.<br /><br />
These Call-up limitations apply to the total value of the Call-up, including any Additional Items listed on this Standing Offer that are included in the Call-up.<br /><br />
<acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> procedures may be requested for requirements of less than&nbsp;$150,000.01&nbsp;for more complex requirements such as those across multiple categories, or where there are large quantities of low dollar value devices.</li>
<li><strong>Over&nbsp;$2,000,000.00</strong> (Including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>): Requirements over&nbsp;$2,000,000.00&nbsp;must be sent to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> in a funded requisition for processing as an open competitive Request for Proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>C.2&nbsp;For Call-ups of Products from More than One Category</h3> 
<p>Where the Identified User's requirement is for products from more than one category and where the Identified User feels that there are administrative advantages in contracting with one supplier only for the requirement, the Identified User is encouraged to calculate the best value for the aggregate requirement. The Call-up limitations defined the Annex entitled &quot;Call-Up Limitations&quot; will apply to any such aggregate requirement and permission must be received from the Standing Offer Authority whenever the aggregate best value would include Products that are not Active. Where the value or volume of the inactive product or products exceeds that of the Active products, the whole requirement will be treated as an exception and the Identified User will need written permission of the Standing Offer Authority before they can make the Call-up.</p>
<h3>C.3&nbsp;For Call-ups of Additional Items only</h3>
<p>The Identified User may place Call-ups valued at up to&nbsp;$25,000.00&nbsp;<acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym> included that consist of Additional Items or consumables only, from any of the Offerors (both Active and Inactive). Any Call-ups of Additional Items exceeding&nbsp;$25,000.00&nbsp;must be issued or approved in writing by the Standing Offer Authority.</p>
<h3>C.4	Requirements of&nbsp;$25,000.00&nbsp;or more (Including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>) that cannot be satisfied by the Active Offeror with the Product(s) with the lowest evaluated cost in the required category</h3>
<p>Where the Standing Offer Authority agrees that the Active Offeror whose product has the lowest evaluated cost in the required category cannot satisfy an Identified User's requirement because that Offeror:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User within the Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract clauses;</li>
<li>does not meet all the legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including equipment security needs;</li>
<li>has failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement; or</li>
<li>has already defaulted on a Call-up issued by the Identified User for the required Products; or,</li>
<li>has shown itself incapable of meeting the service requirements for that specific Identified User,</li>
</ol>
<p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up (or the Identified User requests and receives written permission from the Standing Offer Authority to place a Call-up) with the next highest Active Offeror that can fulfill the needs of the Identified User.</p>
<h3>C.5	Requirements that Cannot be Satisfied by Active Offerors</h3>
<p>Where the Standing Offer Authority determines that the none of the Active Offerors can satisfy an Identified User's requirement in any category because the Active Offerors:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>cannot supply all the Products required by the Identified User within the Delivery time frames specified in the Resulting Contract clauses;</li>
  <li>do not meet all the legitimate operational requirements of the Identified User, including equipment security needs;</li>
  <li>have all failed the compatibility sub-test for that requirement;</li>
  <li>have defaulted on Call-ups for the Products currently required by the Identified User; or,</li>
  <li>have shown themselves incapable of meeting the service requirements for that specific Identified User,</li>
	</ol>
<p>then the Standing Offer Authority may place a Call-up with one of the Inactive Offerors in the relevant category that can satisfy these requirements, at the unit price(s) that Offeror offered during the most recent downward price revision or the Standing Offer Authority may use other sourcing methods to procure the Products. Only the Standing Offer Authority can place Call-ups with Inactive Offerors. The Offeror agrees not to accept any Call-ups, except from the Standing Offer Authority, while it is not an Active Offeror.</p>

<h2 id="annexe-annex-d">Annex D &ndash; Request for Volume Discount (RVD) Procedures</h2>
<h3>D1. Application</h3>
<p>Any requirement which exceeds&nbsp;$150,000.00, <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym> included but is less than&nbsp;$2,000,000.00, or any more complex requirements such as those across multiple sub-categories, or where there are large quantities of low dollar value devices may be submitted to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> in a funded <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> 9200&nbsp;&quot;Requisition for Goods and Services&quot; form for processing as a Request for Volume Discount (RVD).</p>
<p>The requisition must contain:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>the sub-categories relative to the requirement, or generic minimum specifications for the Product(s) including any options or additional equipment;</li>
<li>the number of Products required for each set of minimum specifications;</li>
<li>details of increased or additional services or reports, if required;</li>
<li>the destination details for all Products required including any special shipping instructions;</li>
<li>the Warranty Period requested for each Product;</li>
<li>details of the funding committed;</li>
<li>a signed Business Case, if required;</li>
<li>the required authority signatures and contact details.</li>
</ol>
<h3>D2.	Process</h3>
<p>In the case of a Request for Volume Discount, <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> will review the specifications to determine which <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> wide format products meet the minimum generic specifications. A minimum of two <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> vendors should have qualified products to proceed with an <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>.  If fewer than two vendors carry qualified products, the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> process can not be used and the requirement will be negotiated or handled as an open competitive <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym> in accordance with <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> contracting policies and regulations.</p>
<p><acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>s will be directed only to the companies with Standing Offers, active or inactive.</p>
<p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> will contact the originator of the requisition to discuss the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> scheduling and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>It is recommended that <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> contracting personnel contact the Imaging Product Management Group at 604-775-7088&nbsp;for guidance, if necessary.</p>
<h3>D3.	Qualified Products</h3>
<p>All proposed Products for an <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> must have completed benchmark testing (if applicable) and be listed on the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>s as Active or Inactive.</p>
<p>Products not on the current Standing Offer will NOT be considered although unlisted options may be included if these options connect directly to or are used by the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> equipment proposed. Canada reserves the right to accept or reject any unlisted options proposed.</p>
<p>Canada reserves the right to award the total or a portion only of the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> requirement to the successful Offeror whenever advantageous to Canada. The total requirement may be split between two or more offerors.</p>
<h3>D4.	<acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> Period</h3>
<p> The standard period to submit an offer for the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> will be five (5) working days. If the requirement is urgent, not complex and is estimated to be less than&nbsp;$500,000.00&nbsp;then the period to submit an offer may be reduced to three (3) working days. If particular specifications other than the standard <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> specifications for the selected Categories are significant enough, the period to submit an offer may be extended up to ten (10) working days.</p>
<h3>D5.	Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>  The terms and conditions of the applicable <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym> will apply to and form part of any Contract issued as a result of an <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>. Additional terms and conditions applicable to the specific client may also apply.</p>
<h3>D6.	Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The recommended evaluation methodology for the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> is the selection of the product which achieves the lowest ratio of cost per Benchmark point using as many of the elements of the original evaluation as are applicable. This method may not be used if products from different sub-categories meet the specification as Benchmark results cannot be equitably compared across sub-categories.</p>
<h3>D7.	Compatibility Testing</h3>
<p>Before contract award, <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> may request compatibility testing as described in the section of the Standing Offer entitled Compatibility Sub-Test.</p>
<h3>D8.	Call-up</h3>
<p>Price negotiations may occur prior to issuance of a Call-up resulting from an <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>.</p>
<h3>D9.	Standardization</h3>
<p>It may be preferable for an Identified User to standardize their wide format imaging requirements and contract with one vendor only for a type or model of device for a stated period of time in order to decrease technical and administrative overhead. The Request for Volume Discount process may be used to determine the standardized model or models, where there is sufficient competition within the standing offer, but this intention and the period of time for standardization must be indicated at the time of <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> issue. It will not be permitted to identify that a model or models will be the standard for the Identified User unless it has been identified as such in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All other rules and procedures of the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> will apply including the requirement for a full and sufficient justification of any specifications that may restrict vendors in the identified category or categories from bidding. It will not be permitted to process an <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> for standardization if fewer than two vendors can bid; in these cases, the solicitation will be processed as an <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym>. As with other <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>s, compliance and compatibility testing (if required) will take place before the product is accepted and before the call-up is made.</p>
<p>When a Request for Volume Discount process is utilized to acquire a Standardization requirement based on the Identified User's specific requirement, the Identified User may consider the awarded <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym> model, including additional items, as offering Best Value in the applicable Category for the specific requirements. Once any optional amounts have been exhausted, the Identified User may place subsequent Call-ups with the Offeror in the relevant Category listed in the <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>, at the unit price(s) listed on the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym> site at the time that the subsequent Call-up is issued, with a Call-up limitation of&nbsp;$150,000.00&nbsp;including <acronym title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</acronym>/<acronym title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</acronym>. If the Offeror's Product in the relevant category becomes Inactive, only the Standing Offer Authority can place Call-ups for that Product, and the Identified User must submit a funded requisition to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> for the Call-up amount. The Offeror agrees not to accept any Call-ups, except from the Standing Offer Authority or from the client with written authorization from the Standing Offer Authority, while it is not an Active Offeror.</p>
<p>If a model identified for Standardization is subject to a Product Substitution during the time period of standardization, then the new model may be subject to compliance and compatibility testing if required by the Identified User. If the substituted Product fails to meet the minimum requirements of the original <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>, it will no longer be considered to be the standard for that Category for that Identified User.</p>
<p><strong>All questions related to <acronym title="Request for Volume Discount">RVD</acronym>s against the Wide Format Printers, Wide Format Scanners and Wide Format Multifunction Printers <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>s must be directed to:</strong></p>

<h2 id="annexe-annex-i">Annex I &ndash; Definition and Calculation of Value Factor</h2>
<h3>I1.  Definition of &quot;Value Factor&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Value Factor&quot;</strong> is the term used in this Standing Offer to define the calculations used to determine the Products offering the best value to the Government of Canada, based on the evaluated price and the benchmark score for that Product. The best Value Factor is the Product with the highest score for Value Factor in accordance with this Annex.</p>
<p>The Value Factor will be determined in order to select Offerors for issuance of resulting Standing Offers, to determine the applicable Call-up Limitation, and to determine the &quot;Active Offerors&quot; during each two-month period following a downward price revision.</p>
<p>The Value Factor for each Wide Format Printer and Wide Format Multifunction product will be calculated based on two elements:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>the Evaluated Price (calculated as set out below); and</li>
<li>the total Benchmark Score.</li>
</ol>
  <p>The Value Factor for Category 4.0&nbsp;Wide Format Scanners will be calculated based on the Evaluated Price only (calculated as set out below).</p>
  <p>The best Value Factor determined at the time of a Call-up may depend on the exact configuration required to meet the Identified User's requirements. If substantial reconfiguration is required, a recalculation of the Value Factors will be completed for the specific requirement.</p>
<h3>I2.  Step 1&nbsp;- Calculation of <strong>&quot;Evaluated Price&quot;</strong></h3>
<p>Within each Printer and Multifunction Sub-Category the <strong>&quot;Evaluated Price&quot;</strong> per unit will be the sum of the following:</p>
<p><strong>I2.1</strong> The unit price submitted for the product (including all equipment required for the product to meet the minimum specifications for the Sub-Category), including one full set of initial consumables, user manuals, configuration, delivery, and the provision of one-year of Warranty Services.</p>
<p><strong>I2.2&nbsp; Overage calculation:</strong> If an Offeror is not offering unlimited square foot yield in their unit price for the Warranty Services, an overage calculation of 5% of the yield in Column D of the Yield Evaluation Grid will be calculated.  (<em>See Example 1, 12&nbsp;Month Overage Calculation</em>)</p>
<p><strong>I2.3</strong> The unit price submitted for the installation of the product at final destination. </p>
<p><strong>I2.4</strong> <strong>The Imaging Consumables Cost Factor </strong>(the total cost of imaging consumables, other than media/paper, to produce a specified number of prints or scans, at a specified page coverage).  This will be evaluated using the number of square feet indicated in Column E of the Yield Evaluation Grid.  These yields are based on client reports of estimated average 48&nbsp;month (4&nbsp;years) use. (<em>See Example 3, Consumables Cost Factor Calculation</em>)</p>
<p><strong>I2.5&nbsp; Upgrade to a four (4) year Warranty:  </strong>This will be evaluated based on the quoted Firm Price plus meter charges if applicable, using the square foot yields of Column E of the Yield Evaluation Grid + 5% overage.  (<em>See Example 2, 4&nbsp;Year Warranty Calculation</em>)</p>
<h3>I3. Yield Evaluation Grid</h3>
<table class="basic" summary="This table shows the Yield Evaluation Grid for categories 1.0 to 6.0, it contains 5 columns (A to E) for Categories and Sub-Categories, Printer application, Sq/ft (monthly),  Sq/ft (12 months) and Sq/ft (48 months).">

<h3>I4. Step 2&nbsp;- Benchmark Score</h3>
<p>The Benchmark Score for Printer and <acronym title="multifunction printers">MFP</acronym> Categories will be determined by INTERTEK. The maximum Benchmark Score for each product is 10.  See Annex J, Benchmark Testing, for details on the scoring methodology and allocation of points.</p>
<h3>I5. Step 3&nbsp;- Calculation of &quot;Value Factor&quot;</h3>
<h4>I5.1&nbsp;Printer and <acronym title="multifunction printers">MFP</acronym> Categories</h4>
  <p>For Printer and <acronym title="multifunction printers">MFP</acronym> Categories, the elements will be combined at a ratio of 50% for Total Weighted Average of Evaluated Price (Cost rating) to 50% for benchmark points. The lowest Cost rating will achieve 50&nbsp;points and all other Offerors' Total Evaluated Prices will be pro-rated accordingly.  The Offeror achieving the highest total benchmark points will achieve 50&nbsp;points and all the other Offerors' total points will be pro-rated accordingly.  The Value Factor will be the sum of the each of the two elements after they are prorated.</p>

<h2 id="annexe-annex-j">Annex J &ndash; Benchmark Testing</h2>
<div class="option2">
<p><strong>Note to Offerors:</strong> The Benchmark Testing Procedures and Fees described in this Annex will apply to the evaluation of Offers as well as to proposed substitutions during the Standing Offer Period.</p>
</div>
<h3>J1. Overview</h3>
<p>Benchmark tests on offered printers and <acronym title="multifunction printers">MFP</acronym>'s are mandatory and must be conducted as part of the evaluation. Benchmark testing will not be completed on offered scanner products.  The Benchmark tests must be conducted by the testing authority, INTERTEK Canada Corp, (formerly known as <acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym> Canada Corp. (<acronym title="National Software Testing Labs">NSTL</acronym>)), at the INTERTEK test site located in the National Capital Area. The benchmark procedures have been established in cooperation with INTERTEK. All questions and concerns about these procedures must be addressed to the Contracting Authority. Failure to comply with the benchmark test procedures may result in disqualification of an Offer without further notice.</p>
<h3>J2.  Nature of Testing</h3>
<p>The benchmark testing procedure is not a pass/fail evaluation, unless the benchmark testing reveals that a printer does not meet a mandatory requirement of the solicitation. It is used to generate a score based on the performance (speed), quality of output, features and usability of the printer. This score is used in the determination of Value Factor. The data generated through the benchmark testing will be used for evaluation and posted on the <acronym title="Imaging Product Management Group">IPMG</acronym> site.</p>
<h3>J3. Benchmark Test Schedule</h3>
<p>Canada will submit a list of products to be benchmarked to INTERTEK. INTERTEK, in cooperation with the <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> Contracting Authority, will then draw up the Benchmark Test Schedule. Offerors will be notified by e-mail and/or facsimile of the Benchmark Test Schedule, at least seven (7) calendar days in advance. The notification will include the schedule of delivery dates for each Product to be tested, and detailed instructions regarding delivery of test units, supplies, documents and payments required for the benchmark tests. Failure to deliver the equipment and other items on the specified date(s) and time will result in disqualification if INTERTEK, in its sole discretion, determines that extending the deadline will have an impact on the overall testing schedule.</p>
<h3>J4. Equipment Delivered for Testing</h3>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>Equipment delivered for testing should be accompanied by:
<ol class="lower-roman">
  <li>full payment for all tests;</li>
  <li>the completed INTERTEK Features Questionnaire (available through the Internet before the test period begins);</li>
  <li>a qualified technician to set up and configure the equipment; and</li>
  <li>a complete set of the user manuals normally provided by the Offeror or the <acronym title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</acronym>, in both English and French (or bilingual), both for verification and for use during the testing.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
  <li>Each printer should be delivered with a 10' cable for the Centronics parallel interface. Printers that have both a <acronym title="universal serial bus">USB</acronym> and a parallel interface should be delivered with <acronym title="universal serial bus">USB</acronym> and parallel cables. <acronym title="universal serial bus">USB</acronym>-only devices must incorporate a <acronym title="universal serial bus">USB</acronym> port and include a <acronym title="universal serial bus">USB</acronym> cable.</li>
  <li>The Offeror should also supply two (2) sets of appropriate imaging consumables (not including paper).</li>
  <li>Printers submitted into network categories should include a card and cable for Ethernet 10/100&nbsp;or 100&nbsp;Base T.</li>
  <li>Any Products delivered without all of the above may not be tested by INTERTEK, in which case they will be disqualified as non-compliant.</li>
  <li>Each Product supplied for benchmark testing must meet or exceed the Technical Specifications in Annex A and the Product Details and must be identical to the Product described in the Offer.</li>
	</ol>
<h3>J5. Installation and Configuration for Benchmark Testing</h3>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>It is the Offeror's responsibility to install, set up and test the equipment at the INTERTEK testing site before benchmark testing.</li>
<li>It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that equipment is delivered to the Benchmark test site on the appointed date by 2<acronym title="post meridiem">PM</acronym> <acronym title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</acronym>.</li>
<li>Offerors setting up more than 1&nbsp;machine are expected to bring sufficient staff to complete all set-ups according to the following guidelines:
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>4&nbsp;hours for up to 8&nbsp;machines;</li>
  <li>8&nbsp;hours for up to 16&nbsp;machines; and</li>
  <li>12&nbsp;hours for over 16&nbsp;machines.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
  <li>Failure to set up the Products within these time frames will result in disqualification if INTERTEK, in its sole discretion, determines that extending the deadline will have an impact on the overall testing schedule.</li>
	</ol>
<h3>J6. Inadequate or Malfunctioning Equipment</h3>
<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
<li>If the equipment set up for benchmark testing does not function in compliance with the Technical Specifications in Annex A and/or the technical specifications described in the Offer, or is found to be different from the printer described in the Offer, it will be removed, and a new appointment will be made to deliver an operational and/or compliant printer within 2&nbsp;working days.</li>
  <li>If a printer is unable to complete benchmark tasks with the offered memory and additional memory is required, the Offeror will be given an opportunity to increase the memory for further benchmark testing within 2&nbsp;working days. If the printer completes benchmark testing with the increased memory, the Offeror must furnish this added memory for all Call-ups for the printer without increasing the price (if it is listed in a resulting Standing Offer) or withdraw the printer from consideration.</li>
  <li>If, at the end of this 2-working-day period:
	<ol class="lower-roman">
	<li>the equipment or its replacement exhibits the same fault a second time;</li>
  <li>the equipment or its replacement exhibits another fault;</li>
  <li>the addition of memory does not allow the printer to function in accordance with the Technical Specifications; or</li>
  <li>the Offeror has failed to make the repair or submit the replacement or additional memory,</li>
	</ol>
  the equipment will be eliminated from further consideration in all relevant Sub-Categories.</li>
  <li>Upon request, INTERTEK will demonstrate any fault found during the benchmark tests.</li>
	</ol>
<h3>J7. Return of Equipment After Testing </h3>
<p>Equipment provided for testing may be required for up to 60&nbsp;working days. After the Product has been tested, INTERTEK will contact the Offeror with a date and time for retrieving the Product from the test site. The Offeror must retrieve the Product from INTERTEK within an hour of the appointed date and time. Offerors are strongly advised to inform INTERTEK as soon as they become aware that they might not be able to make an appointment to deliver or retrieve printers.</p>

<h3>J10. Benchmark Testing and Scoring Methodology</h3>
<p>INTERTEK will separate all plotters into the following basic categories:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Plotters</li>
<li>Multi-function Plotters</li>
</ol>
<p>INTERTEK technicians will evaluate each Plotter/MF_Plotter submitted to the benchmark as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Plotter testing will consist of:
<ul>
  <li>Speed (Performance)</li>
	<li>Features</li>
  <li>Usability</li>
<li>Quality</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
<h4>J10.1&nbsp;Test Set-up</h4>
<ul>
  <li>All network related aspects of the benchmark methodology was conducted in a 100&nbsp;Base&nbsp;T Ethernet environment using <acronym title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</acronym> addressing on a Windows 2003&nbsp;Server and a Windows Vista client workstation.</li>

<h5>J10.2.1&nbsp;Speed Scoring Methodology</h5>
  <p>The Speed of each plotter will be tested using a series of predetermined files. INTERTEK uses a number of real world application files in order to give a more realistic indication of the plotter capabilities. The files were created using Microsoft Office, and Adobe Acrobat applications. Each file type contains one or more of the following elements:  graphics sparse text, dense text, fonts, bit-mapped images. The Microsoft Word document contains text, embedded Excel charts, and graphic images. The Microsoft Excel document contains a combination of simple spreadsheets, and a variety of charts. The PowerPoint file is a basic presentation including text and graphics. The Adobe Acrobat <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> file is similar in form to many <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> files in use today, it contains a combination of text and graphics. Please see the below list for a detailed breakdown of the individual files.</p>
	<ol class="decimal">
	<li>Ms Word
	<ul>
	<li>Graphics</li>
	<li>Sparse Text</li>
	<li>Dense Text</li>
	<li>Fonts</li>
	<li>Bit-mapped Images</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>PowerPoint
	<ul>
  <li>Graphics</li>

	<ul>
  <li>Large Graphics</li>
  <li>Large Colour</li>
  <li>AutoCAD</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
  <p>A plotter's raw score on any given test is the time it takes to generate one of the predetermined files. All tests will be performed at least twice to check for relative consistency. All raw scores will be recorded in number of seconds. If the speed times for two runs of the test vary more than 5%, INTERTEK will rerun the test until two scores obtained are within a 5% degree of variance.</p>
  <h6>J10.2.1.1&nbsp;Method</h6>
	<p>The speed tests will be conducted in a network (Windows 2003&nbsp;Server) environment. The tests will be conducted in both <acronym title="printer command language">PCL</acronym> and PostScript modes, where both are available, at the standard and highest resolution of the default driver available. The overall Speed score is based upon the better performing emulation. The plotter vendor / supplier will advise INTERTEK on the resolutions (high and low) that they would recommend for the speed tests.</p>
  <p>To calculate the overall Speed score for each plotter, a geometric mean will be taken of the results for all the speed tests (timed events) for each plotter. The formula for converting the geometric mean to a score is: (minimum geometric mean for all plotters / plotter's geometric mean) in any given category.</p>
  <h5>J10.2.2&nbsp; Quality Scoring Methodology</h5>
  <p>INTERTEK rates the quality of all plotters using the following test categories, where applicable:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Monochrome objectives</li>
	<li>Colour objectives</li>
	</ul>
  <p>The quality of each plotter is evaluated by INTERTEK using the output from several Postscript files. Quality testing will be conducted at the highest resolution and quality settings available for the product. In order to create comparable quality tests for plotters which may not have PostScript capability, INTERTEK has developed its own PostScript interpreter, as a part of its' test suite. The quality output contains both subjective and objective scoring. However, the subjective scoring applies only to the colour plotters.</p>
  <h6>J10.2.2.1&nbsp;Objective tests</h6>
  <p>The monochrome quality tests consist of a series of pages containing such elements as a photographic image, text in a wide range of sizes, and a variety of circles and horizontal and vertical lines. These tests also stress more esoteric features, such as the plotter's paper-handling ability and how well the plotter displays reversed (white on black) text and graphics. These tests demonstrate a plotter's suitability for graphics-oriented applications. The colour quality test examines the ability of the plotter to print a wide range of hues as well as to blend between the hues. It also examines ink placement problems &ndash; the ability of the plotter to accurately place lines without misregistration or smearing. These tests are self-scoring and absolute in that each score is only a function of the particular plotter's abilities, it does not compare one against another.</p>
  <h6>J10.2.2.2&nbsp;Subjective tests</h6>
  <p>One output consists of a set of five photographs scanned on an HP IICX scanner.  They were scanned at 200x200&nbsp;<acronym title="dots per inch">dpi</acronym>, 24&nbsp;bits per pixel.  Two other images are composites of photographs scanned at 600x600&nbsp;<acronym title="dots per inch">dpi</acronym>. The files are full-page images, a bit larger than 8.5x11&nbsp;inches. The quality of these pages are judged relative to the other plotters in the grouping. When quality output from all plotters in a category is completed, a INTERTEK technician will group the output into different categories. Although output will be marked on the back to identify the plotter from which it came, the tester evaluating the quality of the output on the printed side of each sheet will not know which plotter produced any given sheet of output. The technician will judge each element of the output in a given category on a scale of 1&nbsp;to 10. 5&nbsp;is given to the output from these copies to the one representing a relatively average output and the rest are given an appropriate score higher or lower relative to that average output of 5.</p>
  <p>Each quality output file will be generated on paper provided by the vendor.</p>
  <p>To calculate the overall quality score for each plotter, the ratings assigned to each major element will be averaged for each image printed; an average of all of the scores will be calculated to achieve a score. The scaled quality score will be calculated, by multiplying 10&nbsp;for each individual objective overall score divided by the main objective overall score.</p>
  <p>The final score for each plotter will be adjusted to a 10-point scale for easy comparison. An overall quality score of 10&nbsp;thus represents the highest possible score for a plotter in a category.</p>
  <h5>J10.2.3&nbsp;Features Scoring Methodology</h5>
  <p>Prior to the beginning of benchmark testing, vendors will be issued a features questionnaire for each plotter they are submitting. The questionnaire will consist of more than 70&nbsp;items for which vendors specify the particular attributes for each plotter. During the course of benchmark testing, INTERTEK technicians will review the features questionnaire and verify the responses against the plotter and documentation which will be provided for the benchmark. Individual features for each plotter are tabulated in the results section of the report.</p>
  <p>The verified features for each plotter will be scored according to the following methodology. A number of items are assigned weights and scored (<acronym title="exempli gratia">e.g.</acronym>, auto switching between ports). Weighted items are assigned a weight (yet to be determined). Exact weights for each item will be found in the first column of the features table in the data section of the report. A plotter receives a score of &quot;1&quot; (for example) for each weighted feature it includes. The plotter receives a score of &quot;0&quot; for each weighted feature it does not include. If an item is listed as optional, the plotter receives a score of &quot;.5&quot; (for example) for that item. All items for each plotter are then multiplied by the corresponding weight and compared to the total possible number of points for the category. The final score for each plotter will be adjusted to a 10-point scale for easy comparison. An overall features score of 10&nbsp;thus represents the highest possible score for a plotter on the features questionnaire.</p>
  <p>Many of the items in the questionnaire are included for informational purposes only and are not used in the computation of the features score (<acronym title="exempli gratia">e.g.</acronym>, voltages supported).</p>
  <h5>J10.2.4&nbsp;Usability Scoring Methodology</h5>
	<p>During the course of benchmark testing, INTERTEK technicians will review and score each plotter on a number of predefined usability criteria. A sample list of those items is presented below. The INTERTEK technicians will work with the plotter and documentation to perform some basic tasks such as setting up the plotter, loading paper and changing some items on the plotter's setup/control menu. Points will be assigned based on the functionality and ease of use of the plotter.</p>
  <p>An overall usability score will be derived by averaging the scores for all seven items. The final score for each plotter is adjusted to a 10&nbsp;point scale for easy comparison. An overall usability score of 10&nbsp;thus represents the highest possible score for a plotter on the usability questionnaire.</p>
  <h6>J10.2.4.1&nbsp;Usability Items</h6>
	<ul>
  <li>Overall Usability</li>
  <li>Memory Expansion Accessibility</li>
  <li>Paper Handling/Loading</li>
  <li>Ink Medium Installation</li>
  <li>Set up/Control Panel Functionality</li>
  <li>Status Messages / Indicators</li>
  <li>Software Driver Installation</li>
	</ul>
  <p>Network Category ONLY:</p>
	<ul>
  <li>Network Functionality</li>

  <li>Copying</li>
	</ul>
<h3>J10.3&nbsp;Overall Scoring Methodology</h3>
  <p>The overall score is determined by multiplying (score for each individual test type ^ of the weight of each test type) in sequence.</p>
