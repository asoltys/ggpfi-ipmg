<h3 id="a13">13.&nbsp;Environmental Considerations</h3>
 <p>The Government of Canada is committed to reducing its impact on the environment and satisfying clientorganizations' demand for environmentally sensitive products and packaging. In addition to the direct cost reductions in an optimized imaging environment, the reduction, reuse and recycling of packaging and other materials can significantly cut purchasing, operating and disposal costs. While many environmental programs will be applied as result of the use of the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>s for printers and digital copiers (in cases where the supplier will not retain ownership of the imaging fleet) as well as the <acronym title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</acronym>s for remanufactured toner cartridges, as part of their consulting and managed services, Contractors will be expected to address such criteria as: </p>
 <ol class="lower-alpha">
 	<li>The reduction of the volume of packaging materials used when leased or purchased equipment is delivered, including the use of reusable shipping materials, including reusable plastic, crates, and corrugated boxes, where applicable; </li>
   <li>The use of recycled and recyclable materials in the packaging of both imaging devices and their consumables &ndash; new or remanufactured, where applicable; and, </li>
   <li>The use of remanufactured imaging consumables, where applicable.</li>
  </ol>
 
 <p>Contractors are also expected to address such issues as: </p>

 <ol class="lower-alpha">
 	<li>The use of devices permitting reduced power consumption;</li>
   	<li>Third Party Environmental Performance Labeling; </li>
	<li>The impact of imaging devices on indoor air quality; and </li>
   <li>Environmentally sensitive disposal at the end of life for both imaging devices and consumables containers, especially where it would not be appropriate to conduct disposal operations through Crown Assets Disposal.</li>
  </ol>

<h3 id="b9">9.&nbsp;Conflict of Interest</h3>
 <h4>9.1&nbsp;Conflict of Interest &ndash; Future Work</h4>
   <p>The Contractor, during and after the period of performance of the Contract agrees that:</p>
   <ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
   <li>it must not bid for any contract to be let as a result of a solicitation where any work performed by the Contractor under this Contract creates a real or apparent conflict of interest or unfair advantage over other potential suppliers for any resulting contract(s), and must not participate as a subcontractor or consultant in the preparation of any other Bidder's tender or proposal for such a resulting contract; and</li>
   <li>it must not bid for any contract where the Contractor, in its work performed under this Contract, is required to assist Canada in evaluating the bids or in overseeing performance of a resulting contract, and must not participate as a subcontractor or consultant in the preparation of any other Bidder's tender or proposal for such a resulting contract; and </li>
   <li>if its work under the subject Contract involved access to information that would for any reason create a real or apparent conflict of interest or unfair advantage over other potential suppliers for any resulting contract(s), the Contractor must not bid for any of that resulting contract(s) or participate as a subcontractor or consultant in the preparation of any other Bidder's tender or proposal for any resulting contract; </li>
   </ol>
   
 <p>Canada will disqualify any bid from the Contractor (or any entity that either controls or is controlled by the Contractor or, together with the Contractor, is under the common control of a third party, as well as such third party) for contracts as described in this clause, in respect to which Canada determines, at its sole discretion, that the bidder's involvement in this Contract, whether direct or indirect, has resulted in a real or apparent conflict of interest or unfair advantage over other suppliers for the work subject to the solicitation.</p>
 <h4>9.2	Conflict of Interest &ndash; Unfair Advantage</h4>
   <em>The following clause will be included in Request for Proposals resulting from the Supply Arrangement:</em>
 <p>In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, bidders are advised that Canada may disqualify a bid in the following circumstances:</p>
 	<ol class="lower-alpha double-space">
   <li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation;</li>
   <li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees had access to information related to the bid solicitation that was not available to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
   </ol>
 <p>The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing or has provided the goods or services described in the bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. That bidder remains however subject to the criteria established above.</p>
 <p>Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority before bid closing. </p>
 <p>By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest, nor to have an unfair advantage. The Bidder however acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</p>
 <p>Name of Consultants:  Canada has engaged the assistance of the following private sector contractors in the preparation of the bid solicitation:</p>
